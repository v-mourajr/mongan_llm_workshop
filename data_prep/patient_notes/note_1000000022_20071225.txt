This is a 42-year-old White male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 10 years, speaking primarily Spanish. Today, December 25, 2007, he presents for a follow-up visit primarily concerning his persistent asthma. He reports that his asthma attacks have increased in frequency and severity over the past month, often triggered by cold air and physical exertion. He has not experienced recent hospitalizations or emergency room visits for asthma exacerbations.

The patient's significant medical history reveals asthma managed with Flovent, a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler for acute relief, and other conditions including abscess of the salivary gland, generalized and multiple abdominal pains, acute bronchitis, acute pharyngitis, repeated upper respiratory infections, and allergic rhinitis. Additionally, he has a chronic issue of organic impotence, male infertility, unspecified viral infections, chronic bronchitis not specified as acute or chronic, unspecified hypothyroidism, and lumbago. He also has experienced alopecia and nonspecific respiratory abnormalities causing cough and shortness of breath.

The patient is currently using Flovent (inhaled corticosteroid) for his asthma and adheres strictly to this regimen. For his back pain due to lumbago, he utilizes over-the-counter ibuprofen. He reports using medication for acne treatment as needed. He denies the use of any herbal supplements and has no known allergies.

The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. He works in construction, and he believes this may be contributing to his recent asthma exacerbations. He is married and provides substantial support for his family, often staying physically active. His asthma symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, which are relieved with rest and inhaler use. His other chronic condition, organic impotence, is managed with hormone therapy, and he is compliant with regular monitoring of his prolactin and testosterone levels, making adjustments as necessary.

**Objective:**
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 120/80 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 72 beats per minute
- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.7Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 97% on room air

General Appearance:
The patient appears well-developed, well-nourished, and in no acute distress. He is alert and cooperative.

Cardiovascular:
The heart is regular in rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs are appreciated.

Respiratory:
The respiratory examination reveals mild expiratory wheezing bilaterally, more pronounced with forced expiration. No crackles, rhonchi, or stridor noted. Symmetrical chest expansion is present.

Abdomen:

The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact with no focal neurological deficits.

Skin:
Patches of hair loss are noted on the scalp, consistent with alopecia. No acute skin lesions or infections are present.

**Assessment:**
The patient presents with persistent asthma exhibiting increased frequency and severity of attacks, likely exacerbated by environmental triggers and physical exertion. Other chronic conditions include organic impotence managed by hormone therapy, chronic bronchitis, alopecia, lumbago, and acne, all currently stable or managed symptomatically.

**Plan:**
1. Improve asthma management by initiating a long-term inhaled corticosteroid therapy while continuing the use of a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler for acute exacerbations.
2. Educate the patient on correct inhaler usage and strategies to avoid known asthma triggers, especially concerning his construction work environment.
3. Maintain routine monitoring and hormone level adjustments for impotence management.
4. Continue current treatment for alopecia and acne, advising follow-up if symptoms worsen.
5. Recommend physical therapy for managing lumbago, alongside continued NSAIDs for pain as needed.
6. Advise the patient to seek immediate medical help if signs of respiratory infection recur.
7. Schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to evaluate asthma control and make any necessary treatment adjustments.

**Follow-Up:**
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if his symptoms worsen or fail to improve within a week, or if test results indicate the need for further evaluation. Ensure the patient understands the treatment plan and the importance of following up.
