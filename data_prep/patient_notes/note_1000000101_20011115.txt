This is a 51-year-old Asian male who speaks Spanish and has been under our care for chronic musculoskeletal issues for the past three years. He presents to the clinic today, 11/15/2001, for a follow-up visit.

**Subjective:**
The patient’s primary complaints involve persistent lower back pain, hip pain, and occasional neck soreness. He has been experiencing these symptoms for several months, and he notes that the pain has gradually worsened. The lower back pain is described as a dull ache that is more intense in the morning and after prolonged periods of sitting. Hip pain is persistent and exacerbates with weight-bearing activities, while the neck pain is sharp and radiates towards his shoulders intermittently. 

His significant medical history includes various musculoskeletal disorders, particularly disorders of bone and cartilage, benign neoplasms in the pelvic region, and congenital spondylolysis in the lumbosacral area. He has previously experienced a lumbar sprain, hip contusion, neck sprain, and joint pain involving the pelvic region and thigh. Additionally, he has osteoarthrosis affecting the pelvic region and thigh.

Currently, he is taking acetaminophen for pain management and a daily multivitamin. He reports no known allergies and denies the use of herbal supplements. The patient leads a sedentary lifestyle due to his chronic pain issues, is a non-smoker, and denies alcohol use.

**Objective:**
Vital signs:
- Blood Pressure: 140/85 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 78 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.6°F

The patient appears to be in mild distress secondary to pain but is otherwise well-nourished and well-appearing. 

Cardiovascular examination:
Normal heart sounds with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

Respiratory examination:
Clear breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles.

Abdominal examination:
Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.

Musculoskeletal examination:
Tenderness noted over the lower lumbar spine and pelvic region. Reduced range of motion in the lumbar spine. Pain upon palpation of the hip joints. Neck examination reveals tenderness over the cervical spine with a normal range of motion but reproducing pain on rotation. 

Neurological examination:
Normal, no focal deficits noted.

Skin examination:
Unremarkable.

Relevant laboratory findings:
- ESR: Normal
- Blood Urea Nitrogen: Normal
- Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, CO2): Normal
- Calcium: Normal
- Phosphorus: Normal
- Magnesium: Normal
- Complete Blood Count: Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, White Blood Cell Count, and Platelets are within normal limits.
- Urinalysis: Specific Gravity, pH, Glucose, Ketones, Protein, Bilirubin, and Urobilinogen normal.

**Assessment:**
1. Chronic lower back pain, likely due to osteoarthrosis and previously diagnosed lumbar sprain.
2. Hip pain, persistent, related to prior contusion and current osteoarthrosis.
3. Chronic neck pain, predominantly musculoskeletal in nature.

**Plan:**
1. Continue current regimen with acetaminophen. Consider dosage adjustment if pain control is insufficient.
2. Refer to physical therapy, emphasizing core strengthening, lower back, and hip mobility exercises.
3. Prescribe NSAIDs for enhanced pain and inflammation management. Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.
4. Order a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and repeat ESR to rule out underlying inflammatory conditions.
5. Follow-up in 6 weeks to reassess symptom management and therapy response.
6. Encourage patient adherence to physical therapy exercises and promote an active lifestyle within tolerance limits. Advise avoiding prolonged sitting and taking regular breaks.

**Patient Education & Understanding of the Plan:**
The importance of adhering to physical therapy, medication regimen, and lifestyle modifications were discussed. The patient knows to take NSAIDs with food to avoid gastrointestinal discomfort and understands the outlined treatment plan. He is also instructed to contact the clinic should his symptoms worsen or not improve, or if test results necessitate further evaluation.

**Follow-Up:**
The patient will return in 6 weeks for reevaluation. Adjustments to the treatment plan, including potential imaging, will be considered based on his progress and ongoing symptoms.
