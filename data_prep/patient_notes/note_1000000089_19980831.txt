This is a 34-year-old Black male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 16 months. He speaks German and presents today, 31st August 1998, for a follow-up evaluation of his asthma management and review of results from recent laboratory tests.

Subjective:
    Chief Complaints & History of Present Illness:
    The patient reports continuing episodes of asthma exacerbations, which have been more frequent over the past month. He describes experiencing shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness three to four times a week, especially during exercise and at night. He is compliant with his prescribed inhaled corticosteroid and uses his rescue inhaler approximately twice a week. He denies any hospitalizations or emergency room visits for asthma in the past year but is concerned about the increasing symptom frequency.

    Past Medical & Surgical History:
    The patient has a history of asthma, unspecified hearing loss, and chronic joint pain. There is no surgical history on record.

    Medications & Supplements:
    He is currently using an inhaled corticosteroid for long-term control of his asthma and a short-acting beta-agonist (rescue inhaler) as needed. He takes ibuprofen occasionally for joint pain. No herbal supplements or additional medications are reported.

    Social History:
    The patient lives with his partner and works as an accountant. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. Physical activity is limited due to asthma symptoms which worsen with exertion.

    Allergies:
    No known drug, food, or environmental allergies.

    Symptom Details:
    Asthma symptoms started several years ago, with the recent exacerbation lasting for a month. Symptoms are worse with physical exertion and at night. Alleviating factors include the use of his inhaler; however, triggers such as pollen exposure tend to aggravate his symptoms. Pain in the joints is mild to moderate and managed with over-the-counter pain relief. Unspecified hearing loss is noted but not elaborately described.

    Additional Narrative:
    Symptom management includes the use of prescribed inhalers. The patient has recently attempted to avoid asthma triggers more effectively, such as staying indoors during high pollen counts and using air purifiers.
