This is a 35-year-old Black male, fluent in English, who presented to the clinic today for a follow-up visit due to exacerbation of his chronic asthma. Over the past week, he has experienced increased wheezing and chest tightness, particularly pronounced at night and with exertion. While his current medications offer some relief, he reports that these symptoms have notably worsened recently, especially when exposed to cold air. He denies any fever, chills, or recent weight loss.

His medical history is significant for chronic asthma, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis, depressive disorder, unspecified gastrointestinal hemorrhage, slow transit constipation, hemorrhoids, and chronic sinusitis. His asthma has been managed with Albuterol Sulfate, Beconase, Serevent Diskus, and occasionally Augmentin for exacerbations. The patient has a history of generally good adherence to his medications but admits to occasionally missing doses.

He is a non-smoker, lives with his spouse, works in an office setting, and denies illicit drug use. He has no known allergies. Non-pharmacological interventions attempted include using a humidifier and avoiding cold air and vigorous exercise, with limited success recently.

**Objective:**

**Vital Signs:**
- Blood Pressure: 130/85 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 82 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.7Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air

**General Appearance:**
The patient appears well-nourished and in no acute distress, though he exhibits slight dyspnea.

**Cardiovascular:**
Regular rhythm, without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Peripheral pulses are intact.

**Respiratory:**
Inspiratory and expiratory wheezes are heard bilaterally, without rales or rhonchi. The patient is using accessory muscles minimally.

**Abdomen:**
Non-tender and non-distended with active bowel sounds in all four quadrants.

**Musculoskeletal:**
No joint swelling or tenderness. Full range of motion is present in all extremities.

**Neurological:**
The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact, and reflexes are normoactive.

**Skin:**
Skin is warm, dry, with no rashes or lesions.

Recent lab results indicate normal liver function tests, including AST and ALT. Routine blood tests showed no significant abnormalities with WBC, eosinophils, and baseline metabolic panel components within normal limits.

**Assessment:**
The patient is experiencing an exacerbation of chronic asthma, potentially influenced by environmental and seasonal factors. His symptoms of wheezing and chest tightness indicate the need for an adjustment in his current management plan to prevent acute episodes.

**Plan:**
1. **Medication Adjustment:**
   - Increase the dosage of inhaled corticosteroid.
   - Continue the use of short-acting beta agonist (Albuterol Sulfate) as needed for acute symptom relief.

2. **Diagnostic Tests:**
   - Repeat spirometry to evaluate current lung function.
   - Conduct an allergy panel to identify any new or potential allergens.

3. **Referral:**
   - Refer the patient to a pulmonology specialist for further evaluation and management.

4. **Patient Education:**
   - Emphasize the importance of adherence to the medication regimen and the consequences of missed doses.
   - Discuss avoidance of known asthma triggers, including cold air, and vigorous exercise.
   - Reinforce the use of a peak flow meter to monitor asthma symptoms and manage their control effectively.

5. **Follow-Up:**
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess asthma control and symptom management.
   - Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results call for further evaluation.

6. **Emergency Instructions:**
   - Educate the patient on recognizing signs of acute asthma exacerbations and the importance of seeking emergent care if respiratory distress should occur.

The patient demonstrated understanding of the treatment plan and agreed to adhere to the prescribed modifications.
