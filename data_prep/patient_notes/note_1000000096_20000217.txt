This is a 68-year-old Black female patient who has been receiving medical care at our clinic for over two years and primarily speaks Spanish. She has a complex medical history that includes asthma, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, depressive disorders, conversion disorder, and several other chronic conditions. She presented on February 17, 2000, for a routine follow-up visit.

**Subjective:**
The patient reports ongoing respiratory difficulties, including frequent wheezing and shortness of breath, which are most pronounced in the early mornings and late evenings. Despite regular use, she finds her asthma medications only partially effective, resulting in the need for her rescue inhaler several times a week. She also mentions a persistent feeling of sadness, lack of interest in daily activities, and episodes of anxiety and panic. These mental health symptoms have been particularly troublesome recently. Additionally, she describes difficulties with coordination, specifically in her upper limbs, which has affected her daily activities.

She adheres to an albuterol inhaler as required and sertraline for her depressive disorder. She denies smoking, lives alone, and has limited social interaction due to her depressive state.

**Objective:**
Vital signs recorded today include a blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, temperature of 98.6°F, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. 

On physical examination, the patient appears fatigued and anxious but not in acute distress. Her jugular venous pressure is normal, and there is no peripheral edema. Cardiovascular examination shows a regular heart rate and rhythm without audible murmurs or gallops. Respiratory examination reveals bilateral wheezes and a prolonged expiratory phase. The abdomen is non-tender and soft, with normal bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination shows decreased range of motion in both shoulders without visible swelling or tenderness. Neurological examination reveals mild discoordination evidenced by slight dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. Skin examination does not reveal any rashes or lesions.

Laboratory results indicate slight eosinophilia and mildly elevated ESR, aligning with her asthma’s inflammatory nature. Her basic metabolic panel is within normal ranges. 

**Assessment:**
The primary impression is poorly controlled asthma. Additionally, her ongoing depression and conversion disorder, history of myocardial infarction, and coordination troubles are relevant secondary concerns.

**Plan:**
1. **Asthma Management:**
   - Increase the dose of inhaled corticosteroids and introduce a leukotriene receptor antagonist.
   - Reiterate the importance of the asthma action plan and proper inhaler use.
   - Arrange for spirometry to evaluate her lung function.

2. **Depressive Disorder and Conversion Disorder:**
   - Continue sertraline therapy.
   - Refer the patient to psychiatry for further evaluation and possible adjustment of her treatment.
   - Schedule follow-up with mental health services for psychotherapy.

3. **Upper Arm Joint and Coordination Issues:**
   - Referral to physical therapy for targeted shoulder exercises and coordination improvement.
   - Follow-up in one month to assess mobility and coordination progress.

**Follow-Up:**
The patient is advised to contact the clinic should her respiratory or depressive symptoms worsen, or if new symptoms arise. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in one month to review her asthma control, mental health status, and progress with physical therapy.

I provided the patient with educational materials on medication adherence and relaxation techniques to manage anxiety. She acknowledged understanding the plan and agreed to the interventions.
