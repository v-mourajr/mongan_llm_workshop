This is a 14-year-old Hispanic male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 9 years. He speaks English and presents today for management of his asthma.

Subjective:
The patient is here for routine follow-up for his asthma. Recently, he has noted an increase in coughing and wheezing, especially during physical activity and upon exposure to cold air. There has been one notable episode of nighttime shortness of breath that was promptly relieved by his rescue inhaler, albuterol. His mother reports good adherence to his current medication regimen but expresses concern about these recent symptoms. The patient’s asthma has previously led to episodes of bronchitis and one significant bout of pneumonia. 

Regarding his gastrointestinal history, there have been no recent complaints related to the noninfectious gastroenteritis he had previously experienced. Currently, he is taking albuterol as needed, montelukast daily, and using a fluticasone inhaler twice daily. His mother reports compliance with these medications and a notable decrease in acute asthma episodes since starting montelukast.

The patient lives in a smoke-free home with his parents and two siblings. The family avoids known asthma triggers such as pets and environmental smoke. There are no known drug allergies. 

His symptoms began a week ago with increased coughing, particularly during and after physical activities. Though the nighttime coughing has lessened slightly, it still disrupts his sleep. His mother has been using a cold mist humidifier and ensuring he remains well-hydrated to help alleviate symptoms. There has been no recent fever, change in appetite, or weight loss.

Assessment:
The primary diagnosis remains asthma, unspecified without status asthmaticus. While the patient's recurring symptoms indicate an exacerbation, there are no signs of acute respiratory infection. His past issues with bronchitis and pneumonia are history, with no current symptoms. Gastrointestinal complaints are stable, with no new GI symptoms presenting.

Plan:
1. Asthma:
   - Continue montelukast daily and fluticasone inhaler twice daily.
   - Increase albuterol use to every 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing/shortness of breath.
   - Educate on using scarves or masks in cold conditions to prevent symptoms.
   - Continue using a cold mist humidifier at night and encourage hydration.

2. Preventive measures for recurrent bronchitis/pneumonia:
   - Emphasize proper hand hygiene and infection control.
   - Educate on recognizing early respiratory infection signs and establish an action plan.

3. Overall well-being:
   - Encourage a smoke-free environment and avoidance of known triggers.
   - Reinforce medication adherence and the importance of routine follow-up visits.
   - Offer reassurances regarding asthma management.

Follow-Up:
- Instruct patient and family to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or show no improvement within a week.
- Schedule a follow-up visit in 4 weeks or sooner if needed based on symptom severity.

Patient Education & Understanding of the Plan:
The patient's mother confirms understanding of all treatment changes and the emergency action plan. She acknowledges the necessity of monitoring symptoms and following the steps for any symptom escalation, reinforcing the management of asthma at home. Educational materials on asthma management and trigger avoidance were provided and reviewed.

Overall, the patient and his family appear well-educated on his condition and demonstrate a clear understanding of ongoing care requirements.
