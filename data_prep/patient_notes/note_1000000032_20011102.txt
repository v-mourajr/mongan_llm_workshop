Assessment:
    - Diagnosis or Clinical Impression:
    1. Acute nasopharyngitis (common cold)
    2. History of unspecified otitis media
    3. Routine child health check

Plan:
    - For the management of acute nasopharyngitis, continue with current over-the-counter children’s antihistamine as needed. Increase fluid intake and maintain good nasal hygiene with saline drops to assist in symptom relief.
    - Monitor for any signs of secondary infections, such as a worsening cough, high fever, or ear discomfort, which may warrant further evaluation, particularly given the history of otitis media.
    - Instruct the patient’s mother on the importance of hand hygiene and keeping a clean environment to prevent further occurrences.
    - Follow-up within the next two weeks for a routine assessment or sooner if symptoms worsen, particularly any indication of increased respiratory distress.
    - Education on the normal course of a common cold and reassurance provided to the mother regarding the self-limiting nature of the illness.

Instruct patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed. The mother expressed understanding and agreement with the educational and follow-up plan provided.
