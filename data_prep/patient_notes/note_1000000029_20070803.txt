**Subjective:**
This is a 23-year-old Hispanic male who primarily speaks English. He has been under our clinic’s care for approximately nine years. The patient presents today for a follow-up visit concerning his persistent asthma, which often exacerbates in correlation with acute bronchitis episodes. Over the past month, he has experienced increased shortness of breath and wheezing, especially during physical activity and at nighttime. He has been using his albuterol inhaler as needed, which provides partial relief. Recently, he had an episode of acute bronchitis with a productive cough yielding yellow sputum, which lasted for about two weeks and was associated with throat pain. 

The patient also mentions ongoing mental health concerns, including symptoms of depression characterized by low mood, hopelessness, and social withdrawal. His current regimen for asthma and depression includes regular use of inhaled corticosteroids and antidepressants, with no recent changes in these medications. He denies any recent surgeries or significant side effects from his medications.

The patient lives with his parents and is currently a high school student. He maintains a tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drug-free lifestyle. To manage his conditions, he engages in physical activities and follows a balanced diet. He also reports occasional episodes of acute conjunctivitis and allergic rhinitis.

**Assessment:**
The patient shows evidence of poorly controlled asthma exacerbated by a recent episode of acute bronchitis. Persistent depressive symptoms and signs of a psychosis require further mental health evaluation. Additional chronic conditions such as dental caries and weight management issues must continue to be addressed.

**Plan:**

1. **Asthma and Acute Bronchitis:**
   - Continue albuterol inhaler usage as needed.
   - Prescribe a 5-day course of oral prednisone (20 mg daily).
   - Increase the dose of his inhaled corticosteroid (Flovent) to 220 mcg/inh twice daily.
   - Educate on the use of a peak flow meter and reinforce the asthma action plan. 

2. **Depression and Psychosis:**
   - Start cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions once a week.
   - Initiate fluoxetine (10 mg daily), with the intention to adjust according to response and tolerance.
   - Refer to psychiatry for an in-depth evaluation of psychosis symptoms.
   - Emphasize the importance of adherence to mental health management and regular follow-ups.

3. **Laboratory and Clinical Follow-up:**
   - Order a complete blood count (CBC) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) in one month.
   - Schedule psychological and psychiatric assessments within the next two weeks.

4. **Follow-Up Instructions:**
   - Advise a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess symptoms, the efficacy of treatment, and the possible side effects.
   - Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms exacerbate or do not improve within a week, or if adverse reactions occur.
