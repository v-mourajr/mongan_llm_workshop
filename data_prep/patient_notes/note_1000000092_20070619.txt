This is a 38-year-old Black male, fluent in English, who has been a patient at our clinic since June 16, 1998. He presented today, June 19, 2007, for a follow-up visit concerning his chronic asthma. Over the past week, he has experienced an increase in wheezing and chest tightness, particularly at night and with physical exertion. He reports that his asthma symptoms have worsened, especially when exposed to cold air, despite adhering to his current medication regimen. He has not experienced any fever, chills, or recent weight loss.

His medical history includes a diagnosis of asthma, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis, a depressive disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, slow transit constipation, hemorrhoids, and chronic sinusitis. His asthma has been managed with medications including Albuterol Sulfate, Beconase, Serevent Diskus, and Augmentin, particularly during exacerbations. The patient generally adheres to his medication schedule but admits occasionally missing doses.

Socially, he is a non-smoker, resides with his spouse, works in an office setting, and denies any illicit drug use. He does not have any known drug allergies. As non-pharmacological measures, he has been using a humidifier and avoids cold air and vigorous exercise, with limited success recently.

**Objective:**

**Vital Signs:**
- Blood Pressure: 130/85 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 82 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.7Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air

**General Appearance:**
The patient appears well-nourished and is in no acute distress, though slight dyspnea is noted.

**Cardiovascular:**
He has a regular heart rhythm, with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Peripheral pulses are strong and intact.

**Respiratory:**
The examination reveals inspiratory and expiratory wheezing bilaterally. There are no rales or rhonchi, but minimal use of accessory muscles is observed.

**Abdomen:**
The abdomen is non-tender and non-distended, with active bowel sounds in all quadrants.

**Musculoskeletal:**
There is no joint swelling or tenderness, and the patient has a full range of motion in all extremities.

**Neurological:**
The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact, and reflexes are normoactive.

**Skin:**
The skin is warm and dry, with no rashes or lesions.

Recent laboratory results show normal liver function tests, including AST and ALT, with routine blood tests showing no significant abnormalities. White blood cell count, eosinophils, and baseline metabolic panel components are within normal limits.

**Assessment:**
The patient is experiencing an exacerbation of chronic asthma, likely influenced by environmental and seasonal factors. Current symptoms of increased wheezing and chest tightness indicate the need for adjustments in his asthma management plan to prevent acute episodes.

**Plan:**
1. **Medication Adjustment:**
   - Increase the dosage of inhaled corticosteroid.
   - Continue using the short-acting beta-agonist (Albuterol Sulfate) as needed for acute symptom relief.

2. **Diagnostic Tests:**
   - Perform repeat spirometry to evaluate current lung function.
   - Conduct an allergy panel to identify any new or potential allergens.

3. **Referral:**
   - Refer the patient to a pulmonology specialist for further evaluation and management.

4. **Patient Education:**
   - Emphasize the importance of medication adherence and the consequences of missed doses.
   - Discuss strategies to avoid known asthma triggers, including cold air and vigorous exercise.
   - Reinforce the use of a peak flow meter to monitor asthma symptoms and manage control effectively.

5. **Follow-Up:**
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess asthma control and symptom management.
   - Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate the need for further evaluation.

6. **Emergency Instructions:**
   - Educate the patient on recognizing signs of acute asthma exacerbations and the importance of seeking emergent care if respiratory distress occurs.

The patient demonstrated an understanding of the treatment plan and agreed to adhere to the prescribed modifications.
