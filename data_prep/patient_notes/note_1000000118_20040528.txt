**Visit Information:**
- Patient Num: 1000000118
- Visit Date: May 28, 2004

**Subjective:**
This is a 30-year-old Black male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 7 years. The patient communicates primarily in Spanish. He presents today for a follow-up visit, reporting recurring episodes of shortness of breath and a productive cough that has persisted for the past two weeks. The patient attributes these symptoms to his primary diagnosis of asthma. He describes the cough as productive of yellow mucus and notes that symptoms are exacerbated at night and early in the morning. Despite increased use of his albuterol inhaler, he continues to experience chest tightness and has been using the inhaler more frequently without significant relief. The patient also reports occasional wheezing which responds somewhat to steam inhalation.

The patient's past medical history includes asthma, for which he has been treated multiple times over the years. He has a history of acute bronchitis and allergic rhinitis, both of which have been managed previously. Additionally, the patient has undergone multiple surgical procedures for ear deformities due to injuries. These procedures include pedicle or flap graft attachment and plastic repair. The patient was also treated for anxiety, which is likely a sequela from past trauma involving an assault.

The patient currently uses an albuterol inhaler for asthma symptom relief. He takes no other medications or alternative supplements. Socially, he lives with his family and is not currently employed. He denied any allergies to medications or environmental factors.

**Objective:**
Vital signs at today's visit are stable:
- Blood Pressure: 122/78 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 82 beats per minute
- Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.4Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air

On examination, the patient appeared alert, oriented, and exhibited signs of mild anxiety. There were no acute distress observations. Cardiovascular assessment showed regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Respiratory examination revealed decreased breath sounds with bilateral expiratory wheezing and prolonged expiratory phase. There was an increased work of breathing but no presence of rales or rhonchi. The abdominal exam was normal, with no tenderness, distension, or abnormal bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination was unremarkable, except for well-healed surgical scars on both ears from previous reconstructive procedures. Neurologically, the patient showed intact functions with no focal deficits. Skin examination indicated healed surgical scars without signs of infection.

**Assessment:**
The primary clinical impression is an asthma exacerbation, compounded by a persistent productive cough and wheezing.

- Asthma:
  - Assessment: The patient's presentation is consistent with an exacerbation of asthma. The absence of significant relief from increased albuterol use suggests a need for additional therapy.
  - Diagnostic Tests: Recommend peak flow monitoring and pulmonologist evaluation, including spirometry, to better assess and manage lung function.
  - Treatment Plan: Initiate inhaled corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone) to reduce airway inflammation and manage symptoms more effectively. Increase the use of albuterol inhaler to 4 times daily. Educate the patient on the importance of adhering to the prescribed regimen and the use of non-pharmacological measures like steam inhalation.

- Chronic Ear Issues:
  - Assessment: The patient has a history of multiple reconstructive surgeries for ear deformities, related to past trauma.
  - Diagnostic Tests: No additional tests are currently necessary as there are no new or recurring symptoms reported.
  - Treatment Plan: Continue to monitor and educate the patient on the signs of potential complications. Immediate follow-up will be required if new symptoms, such as swelling, pain, or discharge, occur.

**Plan:**
1. Increase the use of the albuterol inhaler to four times daily and introduce inhaled corticosteroids to better control asthma symptoms.
2. Recommend peak flow meter use to monitor lung function at home; provide training and device if the patient does not have one.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to assess the effectiveness of the current management plan and make adjustments if necessary.
4. Counsel the patient on the importance of medication adherence and peak flow monitoring and educate him on recognizing signs that necessitate urgent medical attention.
5. Reinforce the need for non-pharmacological interventions like steam inhalation that provide symptomatic relief.
6. Ensure the patient understands the management plan, including seeking immediate care if symptoms do not improve or worsen within a week.
7. Reinforce emergency contact instructions for worsening respiratory symptoms or any new concerning signs.

The patient has been instructed to follow these guidelines diligently and to contact the clinic promptly if his condition does not improve or if he experiences worsening symptoms. 

Instruct patient to adhere strictly to the prescribed medications and follow-up plan.
