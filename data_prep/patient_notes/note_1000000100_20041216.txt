**Subjective:**
This is a 13-year-old Hispanic male who speaks English and has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately seven years. He presents today for a follow-up concerning his asthma and other respiratory issues. His mother reports that he has been experiencing increased shortness of breath and wheezing episodes over the past two weeks, particularly at night. There have also been frequent coughing episodes and his asthma inhalers currently provide only temporary relief. A recent fever that resolved without intervention has left him feeling generally fatigued and unwell.

The patient's medical history includes significant conditions such as asthma, congenital hydrocephalus, and infantile cerebral palsy. Past interventions have included continuous mechanical ventilation and enteral infusion of nutritional substances. His history of pneumonia, respiratory abnormalities, and nonpyogenic meningitis further adds to the complexity of his condition. 

Currently, he uses Atrovent and Qvar for asthma management, Dilantin for epilepsy, and Propulsid for gastrointestinal symptoms. His adherence to the medication regimen is noted to be good, although his response to the treatments has been inconsistent recently.

His social history reveals that he lives at home with his supportive parents and attends elementary school with special education services. There are no new environmental factors at home or school that could be contributing to the exacerbation of his symptoms.

He has no known drug or food allergies. The onset of his current symptoms has been gradual, with the main issues being increased wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, mainly aggravated during nighttime without specific alleviating factors, apart from temporary relief with inhalers.

**Objective:**
- **Vital Signs:**
  - Blood Pressure: 100/65 mmHg
  - Heart Rate: 95 bpm
  - Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths per minute
  - Temperature: 99.1°F (37.3°C)
  - Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air
- **General Appearance:**
  The patient appears well-nourished, albeit slightly fatigued. He is alert and cooperative during the examination.
- **Cardiovascular:**
  Regular heart rate and rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
- **Respiratory:**
  Mild intercostal retractions are noted. Lung sounds are diminished bilaterally with diffuse expiratory wheezes. No crackles or rhonchi are heard.
- **Abdomen:**
  The abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no organomegaly noted. Normal bowel sounds are present.
- **Musculoskeletal:**
  No musculoskeletal abnormalities are detected. The patient demonstrates normal range of motion and muscle strength appropriate for his age and condition.
- **Neurological:**
  The patient is alert and oriented. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. Reflexes are brisk but symmetrical.
- **Skin:**
  Warm and dry with no rash or lesions.

**Assessment:**
The primary diagnosis remains asthma, which is currently exacerbated and not well-controlled. Secondary diagnoses include congenital hydrocephalus and infantile cerebral palsy. The patient also appears to have had a recent respiratory infection, inferred from his recent fever and ongoing generalized fatigue.

**Plan:**
1. **Asthma Management:**
   - Reinforcement of the use of Qvar and Atrovent as prescribed.
   - Initiate a short course of oral corticosteroids to manage the current exacerbation.
   - Schedule pulmonary function tests to assess current asthma status and adjust medications accordingly.

2. **Neurological and Developmental Concerns:**
   - Continue Dilantin for seizure management with regular neurological follow-up.
   - Maintain ongoing therapy sessions (physical, occupational, and speech) tailored to his needs related to cerebral palsy.

3. **Respiratory Infection:**
   - Closely monitor respiratory status and consider antibiotic therapy if bacterial infection is suspected.
   - Administer regular nebulization with bronchodilators as needed for symptom relief.

4. **Investigations:**
   - Repeat key laboratory tests including a complete blood count (CBC), blood gases, and inflammatory markers to monitor his current status and guide further treatment.

**Follow-Up:**
- Instruct the patient and his mother to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if laboratory and other diagnostic test results indicate the need for further evaluation.
- Plan a follow-up visit in two weeks to reassess his respiratory status and overall health progress.
- Educate the mother on recognizing signs of asthma exacerbation and reinforce the asthma action plan, ensuring she understands the treatment and medication protocols.
