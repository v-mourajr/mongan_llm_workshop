This is an 11-year-old Hispanic male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 6 years. He speaks English and presents today for a follow-up visit to manage his asthma.

Subjective:
The patient is here for a follow-up regarding his asthma management. His mother reports that over the last week, he has experienced increased coughing and wheezing, particularly during physical activities at school and exposure to cold air. There was one episode of shortness of breath during the night which was relieved with his rescue inhaler, albuterol. There have been no hospital admissions or emergency department visits since the last follow-up. 

Past medical history includes asthma with multiple episodes of respiratory infections, including bronchitis and pneumonia. He also has a history of gastrointestinal issues, such as noninfectious gastroenteritis.

He currently uses albuterol as needed, montelukast daily, and a fluticasone inhaler twice daily. His mother reports adherence to the medication regimen, and they have observed a general reduction in acute asthma episodes since starting montelukast.

The patient lives in a smoke-free home with his parents and two siblings. The family has no pets, and he attends school regularly without other known environmental triggers. There are no known drug allergies.

Symptoms began one week ago with increased coughing, particularly noticeable during physical activities. Nighttime coughing has been disturbing his sleep, and wheezing has been noted, which improved with the use of his albuterol inhaler. His mother has been using a cold mist humidifier and ensuring he remains hydrated. There have been no recent changes in appetite or weight, and no fever has been noted.

Assessment:
The primary diagnosis remains asthma, unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus. The patient's current symptoms are consistent with an exacerbation of asthma. Additionally, he has a history of recurrent bronchitis and pneumonia; however, there are no current symptoms indicating acute respiratory infections. The patient's gastrointestinal complaints have been stable, and there are no new symptoms suggestive of a gastrointestinal condition at present.

Plan:
1. Asthma:
   - Continue current medications: montelukast daily, fluticasone inhaler twice daily.
   - Increase albuterol use to every 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing and shortness of breath.
   - Avoid exposure to cold air by using scarves or masks during outdoor activities.
   - Reinforce using a cold mist humidifier at night and ensuring adequate hydration.

2. Recurrent bronchitis/pneumonia:
   - Advise on proper hand hygiene and infection control measures.
   - Provide education on recognizing early signs of respiratory infections and an action plan if symptoms arise.

3. General well-being:
   - Encourage continued avoidance of smoke and other environmental triggers.
   - Provide reassurance regarding the management of asthma and the importance of medication adherence.
   - Discuss the importance of regular follow-up visits and monitoring of symptoms.

Follow-Up:
- Instruct the patient and family to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week.
- Schedule a follow-up visit in 4 weeks or sooner if indicated by symptom severity.
