### Subjective:
This is the case of a 13-year-old Black male who presents to the clinic with ongoing health concerns. The patient has been consistently attending our clinic for approximately six years, accompanied by his mother, both of whom speak English.

The chief complaint today involves recurrent acute pharyngitis, significantly increasing in episodes over the past few months. His mother reports that he has experienced at least ten instances of sore throat, with accompanying symptoms including throat pain, low-grade fever, and occasional difficulty in swallowing. Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen have provided temporary relief; however, the symptoms frequently recur.

The patient and mother also mention concerns regarding repeated ear infections over the past year, typically characterized by ear pain and discharge. These episodes have been classified as acute suppurative otitis media and have necessitated multiple antibiotic treatments with only partial and varying effectiveness.

Additionally, the patient has been experiencing considerable fatigue and shows decreased interest in school activities. Despite these health issues, his social history remains positive, describing a supportive family environment and regular school attendance. He denies any known allergies and reports no adverse effects from current medications.

### Plan:
1. **Recurrent Acute Pharyngitis:**
   - Conduct a rapid antigen detection test to rule out streptococcal infection.
   - Recommend saline gargles and warm fluids to soothe throat irritation.
   - Continue using acetaminophen for pain and fever management, monitoring for any side effects.
   - Refer the patient to an ENT specialist for further evaluation due to the frequency and chronic nature of these episodes.

2. **Acute Suppurative Otitis Media:**
   - Initiate a new course of antibiotics based on the latest culture and sensitivity results.
   - Discuss the possibility of tympanostomy tube placement with an ENT specialist if infections persist despite medical management.
   - Educate the patient and mother on methods to prevent future infections and maintain ear hygiene.

3. **Fatigue:**
   - Order a complete blood count (CBC) to identify underlying infections or anemia.
   - Advise a nutritionally balanced diet rich in iron and vitamins to support overall health and energy levels.
   - Encourage moderate physical activity while avoiding excessive physical exertion.

4. **Follow-Up:**
   - Instruct the patient and his mother to monitor symptoms closely and contact the clinic if pharyngitis or otitis media symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week.
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
   - Ensure the patient and family understand the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics and provide guidance on symptom monitoring and prevention.

Patient education was thoroughly provided, emphasizing the importance of adherence to the treatment plan. They were instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or do not improve as expected.
