**Subjective:**
This is a 21-year-old Asian male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 3.5 years. He communicates primarily in Spanish and presents today for a follow-up of his asthma, which has been previously classified as both unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus and extrinsic asthma without mention of status asthmaticus. The patient reports an increase in both the frequency and severity of his wheezing and shortness of breath over the past two weeks, with symptoms being more pronounced at night, resulting in difficulty sleeping. He mentions that his use of the albuterol inhaler has increased to almost daily use, which provides only temporary relief. 

In the recent past, the patient has also been seen for acute pharyngitis and episodes of abdominal pain. He has not had any emergency room visits or hospitalizations for his asthma recently. There are no reports of fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. 

He currently takes albuterol inhaler for acute symptoms and fluticasone propionate as a maintenance medication. However, he admits to occasionally forgetting his evening dose of fluticasone. The patient denies the use of herbal supplements. 

Social history reveals that the patient is a high school student living with his parents. He does not smoke or consume alcohol. His household does not have pets, but he mentioned the use of fans for cooling, which can sometimes stir up dust. He has been managing his asthma with medication while trying to avoid known triggers.

**Assessment:**
The patient’s primary diagnosis continues to be asthma, unspecified without status asthmaticus, and extrinsic asthma without mention of status asthmaticus. The current exacerbation is likely triggered by environmental factors, specifically dust exposure. Additional relevant diagnoses include a history of acute pharyngitis and intermittent abdominal pain.

**Plan:**
- **Asthma Management:**
  1. Continue current medications: albuterol inhaler as needed for acute symptoms and fluticasone propionate as a maintenance inhaler.
  2. Emphasize the importance of adherence to the controller medication to prevent future exacerbations.
  3. Advise the patient on strategies for identifying and managing asthma triggers. Recommend the use of HEPA filters at home and maintaining a dust-free living environment.
  4. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks or sooner if symptoms persist or worsen. Provide a spacer for inhaler use to optimize medication delivery.

- **Environmental Control:**
  1. The patient will receive a referral to a social worker for a detailed assessment of his home environment and to provide resources for improving living conditions.

- **General Follow-Up Care:**
  1. Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week.
  2. Review the asthma action plan with the patient, emphasizing when to seek urgent care.
