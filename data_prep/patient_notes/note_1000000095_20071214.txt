This is a 51-year-old Indian male who has been a patient at our clinic since September 22, 1997. He speaks German and presents today, December 14, 2007, for follow-up, primarily to address his asthma, which has recently worsened.

### Subjective:
The patient reports worsening asthma symptoms, including increased wheezing and shortness of breath, particularly at night over the past week. Despite regular use of his albuterol inhaler, he finds its effectiveness has decreased. He has a history of recurrent asthma exacerbations and experiences additional respiratory challenges including a past diagnosis of pneumonia and pulmonary eosinophilia. Further, he has a significant medical history of fractures involving the radius and humerus and osteoarthrosis of the upper arm which results in ongoing joint pain and stiffness. He denies any known drug allergies.

The patient’s current medications include the albuterol inhaler for asthma and over-the-counter NSAIDs for his osteoarthrosis. Socially, he lives with his spouse and two children and works as an engineer. He does not smoke, nor does he consume alcohol or use illicit drugs.

### Objective:
**Vital Signs:**
- Blood Pressure: 135/88 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 90 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths/min
- Temperature: 98.7°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 93% on room air

**General Appearance:**
The patient appears well-nourished but in mild respiratory distress. He is alert and oriented.

**Cardiovascular:**
Heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs noted. There is no peripheral edema.

**Respiratory:**
Bilateral wheezing is noted upon auscultation, more prominent in the upper lobes. Mild intercostal retractions are present with no rales or rhonchi.

**Abdomen:**
The abdomen is soft, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. There is no hepatosplenomegaly.

**Musculoskeletal:**
Examination of the upper extremities shows no deformities or new fractures. Mild crepitus in the shoulders is present, consistent with osteoarthrosis. Range of motion is slightly restricted.

**Neurological:**
No focal neurological deficits are found. The patient is neurologically intact.

**Skin:**
The skin exam demonstrates no rashes, bruises, or lesions.

### Assessment:
The patient is experiencing an exacerbation of asthma, likely triggered by environmental factors or suboptimal adherence to a preventive treatment regimen. His history includes stable diagnoses of pneumonia and pulmonary eosinophilia as well as upper arm osteoarthrosis and previous fractures.

### Plan:
1. **Asthma Management:**
   - Increase the frequency of albuterol inhaler use to 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed.
   - Initiate a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), such as fluticasone, daily to manage chronic inflammation.
   - Educate the patient on proper inhaler technique and the significance of stringent adherence to daily ICS therapy.
   - Provide a peak flow meter and instruct the patient to log daily peak expiratory flow measurements for monitoring.
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to assess asthma control and lung function.

2. **Osteoarthrosis Management:**
   - Continue NSAIDs for pain relief as required.
   - Recommend physical therapy tailored to enhance joint functionality and decrease stiffness.
   - Consider referral to a rheumatologist should symptoms persist without improvement.

3. **General Care:**
   - Review recent lab results including liver function tests and a complete blood count, taking into account the patient’s medication use and comorbidities.
   - Educate the patient on identifying common asthma triggers and avoiding exposure to known allergens and irritants.

### Follow-Up:
The patient is instructed to contact the clinic should symptoms fail to improve or worsen within a week, or should test results indicate the necessity for further evaluation. The importance of adhering to the treatment plan is emphasized to prevent future exacerbations and ensure stable management. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in 4 weeks to re-evaluate asthma management and overall health status.
