This is an 18-year-old Black female who speaks Spanish and has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 11 years. She presents today for a follow-up appointment regarding her primary diagnosis of asthma, which has been her most significant health concern. The patient reports increased difficulty with wheezing and shortness of breath over the past week, particularly noticeable at night and during physical activities. She describes a persistent cough that has been interfering with her sleep. Despite regular use of her prescribed albuterol inhaler as needed and daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, her symptoms have not shown substantial improvement.

The patient's medical history includes recurrent asthma exacerbations, often without status asthmaticus, and several episodes of extrinsic asthma. She has also had episodes of pneumonia, acute upper respiratory infections, and allergic rhinitis due to various triggers. There is no significant surgical history. Her past treatments were well-tolerated until the current exacerbation period.

She currently uses albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis and a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid daily. There are no additional medications or herbal supplements reported. She resides in an urban environment, which could potentially expose her to various environmental allergens, exacerbating her asthma. Her social history is notable for limitations in physical activities due to her symptoms, which impacts her school attendance and social engagement. There are no known allergies.

Symptom details include:
- Onset one week ago.
- Located primarily in the chest.
- The symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, and a persistent cough, with increased frequency at night and during physical exertion.
- These symptoms are temporarily relieved by inhaler use.
- They are aggravated by physical activities and timing at night.
- Described as moderately severe, disrupting sleep and limiting daily activities.

The patient has not experienced significant improvement despite increased use of her inhaler and has mild throat irritation likely due to the corticosteroid use.

Objective:
Vital signs today are:
- Blood Pressure: 102/65 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 98 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths/minute
- Temperature: 37.0Â°C
- Oxygen Saturation: 94% on room air

General appearance: The patient appears in mild distress with labored breathing yet remains alert and oriented.
Cardiovascular: Normal rate and rhythm without murmurs or gallops.
Respiratory: Audible wheezing throughout all lung fields, a prolonged expiratory phase, no crackles or rhonchi, and use of accessory muscles noted.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly noted.
Musculoskeletal: No swelling or tenderness in the joints; the patient has normal range of motion.
Neurological: Alert, oriented, with normal reflexes and motor functions.
Skin: No rashes or lesions observed.

Recent laboratory findings show normal ranges for Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine, Sodium, and Potassium. Eosinophil count and certain white blood cell counts are elevated, indicating an eosinophilic response consistent with asthma exacerbations. Capillary blood gases indicated a mild elevation in PCO2, suggesting slight respiratory difficulty.

Assessment:
1. Asthma exacerbation:
   The patient is experiencing worsening of asthma symptoms, evidenced by increased wheezing, shortness of breath, and cough.

2. Acute upper respiratory infection:
   This likely contributes to her asthma exacerbation.

3. Hypopotassemia, resolved:
   Previously noted, suggestive of treatment for prior respiratory distress.

Plan:
- Increase the dosage of the inhaled corticosteroid to manage inflammation.
- Administer a short course of oral corticosteroids to address acute exacerbation.
- Review and reinforce the proper use and frequency of the albuterol inhaler with the patient and her mother.
- Implement peak flow monitoring for better asthma management.
- Plan for repeat pulmonary function tests to assess lung status and function.

For the acute upper respiratory infection:
- Manage symptoms with adequate fluids, rest, and OTC antipyretics as needed.
- Consider a throat culture if symptoms persist or worsen.

Regarding hypopotassemia, which is resolved:
- Continue to ensure adequate dietary potassium intake and hydration.

Patient education and follow-up:
The patient and her mother were instructed on medication adherence, proper use of the inhaler and spacer, and the importance of avoiding environmental triggers. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in two weeks to re-evaluate her symptoms and adjust the asthma management plan as needed. They were advised to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or if there is no improvement within a week. The family acknowledged understanding of the treatment plan and agreed to comply with the recommendations.
