Assessment:
    - Diagnosis or Clinical Impression:
        The patient presents with recurrent unspecified otitis media. Given the lack of improvement on antibiotics, a reevaluation of the treatment plan is warranted.
    - Issue/Problem/Request 1:
        Assessment:
            Likely diagnosis: Otitis Media with potential antibiotic resistance.
            Differential diagnosis: Viral otitis media.
        Diagnostic Tests:
            Plan to repeat a middle ear culture to identify any resistant bacteria.
        Treatment Plan:
            Consider changing the current antibiotics to a broader spectrum if culture results confirm bacterial resistance. Recommend symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen for pain relief.
            Relevant referrals: Referral to an otolaryngologist if persistent or worsening symptoms occur despite the change in treatment.

Follow-Up:
    - Instructions for emergent follow-up care or monitoring:
        Instruct patient’s mother to return to the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate the need for further evaluation.
