This is an 11-year-old Hispanic male who has been receiving care at our clinic for various health issues over the past few years. The patient and his family primarily speak Spanish. He presents today, September 6, 2001, for a scheduled follow-up visit to manage his known conditions, including asthma and epilepsy. 

**Subjective:**
The patient’s mother reports that he has been experiencing increased asthma symptoms over the past week, including coughing and shortness of breath, particularly at night. There is also mention of an onset of a mild fever three days ago, which has since resolved with no other significant symptoms such as rash or gastrointestinal upset. The family denies any new environmental changes or known allergen exposures. They affirm continuation of all prescribed medications, including an inhaled bronchodilator and a daily corticosteroid. The patient has a notable history of acute upper respiratory infections, unspecified allergies, epilepsy, and routine otitis media diagnoses. His mother expresses concern about his persistent wheezing despite adherence to the medication regimen and recent episodes of epilepsy, which remain under fair control with current anticonvulsant therapy.

**Past Medical & Surgical History:**
The patient's medical history is significant for chronic asthma, epilepsy without intractability, and previous surgical intervention for an inguinal hernia and varicocele. His history also includes episodes of fever, impetigo, unspecified otitis media, and a hydrocele. He has undergone routine general medical examinations, which noted an intermittent lack of expected normal physiological development.

**Medications & Supplements:**
The patient currently takes:
- Inhaled Albuterol as needed for asthma symptoms.
- Daily inhaled corticosteroid for asthma control.
- Anticonvulsant medication for epilepsy; specific type not mentioned.
There have been no recent changes in his medication regimen, and the patient reportedly adheres to all prescribed treatments.

**Social History:**
The patient lives at home with his parents and younger sister. The household primarily communicates in Spanish. There is no smoking in the home. He attends school regularly but has missed several days due to his medical conditions. The family reports good adherence to follow-up appointments and medication refills.

**Allergies:**
No specific known drug allergies were reported during this visit.

**Symptom Details:**
The patient reports increased nocturnal wheezing and coughing, which aggravates his breathing difficulties. The fever seemed to be mild and transient, resolving within two days. There are no current signs of rash or unusual skin eruptions.

**Additional Narrative:**
Non-pharmacological interventions like ensuring a dust-free environment and the use of air purifiers have been employed at home with minimal impact on symptom relief. The patient has tolerated medications well, with minor side effects such as occasional dizziness associated with his anticonvulsant therapy.
