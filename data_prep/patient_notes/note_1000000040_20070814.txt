### Subjective:
This is a follow-up visit for a 16-year-old Black male who has been a patient at our clinic for approximately 10 years. The patient and his mother, both English speakers, report numerous health concerns. The primary complaint involves recurrent sore throat episodes, particularly acute pharyngitis, which have significantly increased in frequency. The patient experienced eleven instances of sore throat over the past year, described by pain, low-grade fever, and difficulty swallowing. Over-the-counter analgesics like acetaminophen have been partially effective, but symptoms recur frequently.

The patient also has recurring ear inflammation, diagnosed previously as acute suppurative otitis media, observable in the past year with symptoms like ear pain and discharge. Despite multiple antibiotic courses, the response has been inconsistent.

Additionally, the patient expresses feelings of sadness and difficulty concentrating, indicative of a major depressive disorder. These symptoms have impacted his interest in school and daily activities. Treatment with Bupropion and Zoloft has shown some improvements, but symptoms persist. He denies any non-medication allergies and adverse reactions to current medications.
