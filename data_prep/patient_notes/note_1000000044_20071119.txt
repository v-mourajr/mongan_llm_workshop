This is a 14-year-old Asian male who has been receiving care at our clinic since December 31, 1998. He speaks English and presents today for a routine follow-up for his asthma management and overall health. He has a documented history of asthma, unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus. The patient has been on albuterol sulfate, 4 mg tablets, for managing his symptoms and has used this medication as needed with satisfactory relief.

Chief Complaints and History of Present Illness:
Today, the patient and his parents report that while his asthma maintenance is generally effective, he experiences intermittent episodes of wheezing and shortness of breath, particularly induced by physical exertion and exposure to cold air. These episodes are managed with home care, and there have been no hospitalizations or emergency room visits since the prior visit. However, he experiences occasional nocturnal coughing that disrupts sleep approximately once or twice a week.

Past Medical and Surgical History:
The patient has a history of multiple contusions, occasional conjunctivitis, and atopic dermatitis. There is also a mild contusion of the knee reported from recent play activities. Past minor injuries, such as contusions and abrasions, have resolved without complications. No surgical history is noted.

Medications and Supplements:
He uses an albuterol inhaler as needed and does not take any herbal supplements or over-the-counter medications.

Social History:
The patient follows a balanced diet and engages in regular physical activity. He lives with his parents in a healthy, supportive, and smoke-free environment.

Allergies:
There are no known allergies.

Symptom Details:
Intermittent wheezing and shortness of breath primarily triggered by physical activity and cold air. Occasional nocturnal episodes of coughing disrupting sleep once or twice a week. Healing abrasion on the knee with no signs of infection.

3. Encourage the patient to maintain regular physical activity, incorporating gradual warm-ups, especially during cooler weather to prevent asthma triggers.

5. Schedule a routine follow-up in six months to reassess asthma control, or sooner if necessary.
6. Ensure the patient is up-to-date with vaccinations and routine health check-ups.

Follow-Up:
Parents are instructed to contact the clinic if the patient's asthma symptoms become severe, such as persistent shortness of breath or an increased need for the albuterol inhaler. They are advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms escalate before the next scheduled appointment.
