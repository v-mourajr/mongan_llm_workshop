This is a 23-year-old Black female who speaks English and has been under our care since July 31, 2000. She presented to the clinic on September 29, 2004, for a follow-up primarily concerning asthma management. Over the past three months, she experienced recurrent episodes of coughing and difficulty in breathing, which have become more frequent. Her symptoms tend to be triggered by physical exertion, dust, and cold air. She has been compliant with her medication regimen, which includes a combination inhaler (corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist) and a short-acting beta-agonist for acute symptoms. She finds her medication effective but acknowledges that symptoms persist.

Her past medical history is notable for asthma (unspecified without status asthmaticus), recurring episodes of bronchitis, a history of pectus excavatum, and occasional unspecified cough. She has experienced multiple instances of viral infections and an abnormal Pap smear in the past. She is a non-smoker, does not consume alcohol, and is currently a college student living in a dormitory setting, which may expose her to various respiratory irritants. She reports no known allergies.

During today's visit, she describes her nocturnal and early morning coughs as non-productive, lasting around 15 minutes, and often leaving her short of breath. She rates her symptom severity as 6 out of 10. Aggravating factors include exercise, while temporary relief is achieved through rest and the use of her rescue inhaler.

Vital signs today reveal a blood pressure of 118/74 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, a temperature of 98.6°F, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. 

On physical examination, the patient appears well and in no acute distress. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Respiratory examination disclosed bilateral wheezing with a prolonged expiratory phase, and no crackles or rhonchi. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with normal bowel sounds. The musculoskeletal examination shows a normal range of motion in all extremities without joint swelling or tenderness. Neurological examination is unremarkable with intact cranial nerves II-XII, motor strength of 5/5 in all extremities, and reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Skin examination is unremarkable with no rashes, lesions, or cyanosis noted.

In summary, the patient’s recurring and persistent respiratory symptoms are consistent with poorly controlled asthma, unspecified without status asthmaticus, and associated cough. Other considerations include exercise-induced bronchospasm and potential exacerbation due to environmental factors.

Our immediate plan is as follows:
- Continue her current combination inhaler therapy.
- Increase the evening dose of her combination inhaler to improve nocturnal symptom control.
- Introduce a leukotriene receptor antagonist to manage any underlying allergic response.
- Schedule spirometry to evaluate lung function and document airway obstruction severity.
- Arrange for a chest X-ray to exclude any structural issues related to pectus excavatum.
- Conduct allergy testing to identify potential environmental allergens.

The patient has been educated on avoiding known triggers, especially within her living environment, correct inhaler use, and the importance of medication adherence. She is instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or remain unchanged within a week, or if further evaluation is required based on test results.

A follow-up appointment is scheduled in 4 weeks to review spirometry and chest X-ray results and reassess her response to the adjusted treatment regimen. The patient has verbally acknowledged the instructions and understands the significance of adherence to the treatment plan and trigger avoidance.
