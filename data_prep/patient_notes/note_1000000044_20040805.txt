This is an 11-year-old Asian male who has been a patient at our clinic since December 31, 1998, presenting today for a scheduled follow-up on August 5, 2004. The patient communicates in English. He has a documented history of asthma, specifically unspecified asthma without mention of status asthmaticus. He comes in today for a comprehensive evaluation of his asthma management and overall health.

Since his last assessment in September 2001, the patient's asthma symptoms have been moderately controlled. The patient relies on a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler (albuterol) as needed, which provides satisfactory acute relief. His parents report that he experiences intermittent episodes of wheezing and shortness of breath, typically triggered by physical exertion and exposure to cold air. These episodes are manageable at home, and there have been no ER visits or hospitalizations since the prior visit. However, the patient has occasional nighttime coughing episodes that disrupt sleep once or twice a week. The family practices diligent asthma management strategies, including maintaining a smoke-free home environment.

The patient has a medical history that includes multiple contusions from minor injuries typical of an active child, occasional conjunctivitis, some atopic dermatitis, and a mild contusion of the knee from recent play. His past minor injuries, such as contusions and abrasions, have healed without complications.

He uses an albuterol inhaler as needed and does not take any herbal supplements or over-the-counter medications currently. There are no known allergies.

In addition to managing asthma, the patient's lifestyle includes a balanced diet and regular physical activity. He resides with his parents, who promote a healthy, supportive environment.

During today's visit, the patient presents with intermittent wheezing and shortness of breath primarily induced by physical activity and cold air. His parents also noted a healing abrasion on his knee. He experiences occasional nighttime coughing episodes that disrupt his sleep profile, occurring once or twice a week.

Vital signs recorded include blood pressure at 98/60 mmHg, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, temperature at 98.7Â°F, and oxygen saturation at 98% on room air.

On examination:
- The patient appears active and well-nourished, with no signs of distress.
- Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
- Respiratory exam demonstrates clear lungs bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi are detected during the visit. Chest expansion appears symmetrical.
- The abdominal exam shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly.
- Musculoskeletal assessment shows normal range of motion in all extremities without swelling or deformities.
- Neurological exam confirms the patient is alert and oriented. Reflexes are normal and age-appropriate developmental responses noted.
- Skin examination shows a healing abrasion on the knee with no signs of infection, and no other rashes or lesions are observed.

Clinical Impression:
1. Well-controlled asthma with intermittent exacerbations.
2. Healing abrasion on the knee.
3. History of mild contusions and occasional conjunctivitis.

Plan:
1. Continue the current asthma management plan with albuterol inhaler as needed.
2. Educate the patient's parents on early detection of asthma exacerbations and emphasize adherence to the asthma action plan.
3. Reinforce maintaining regular physical activity, incorporating gradual warm-ups, especially during cooler weather to mitigate asthma triggers.
4. Monitor the knee abrasion for signs of infection; keep it clean and protected.
5. Schedule a routine follow-up in six months to reassess asthma control or sooner if required.
6. Ensure the patient is current with vaccinations and health checks during routine visits.

Follow-Up:
Parents are advised to contact the clinic if the patient's asthma symptoms become severe, such as persistent shortness of breath or increased reliance on the albuterol inhaler. Reinforce the importance of monitoring and seek medical advice if symptoms escalate before the next appointment. Parents are educated on asthma management practices; they express understanding and agreement to the plan.

The patient and family were provided with thorough education regarding the asthma management plan and the importance of follow-up care.
