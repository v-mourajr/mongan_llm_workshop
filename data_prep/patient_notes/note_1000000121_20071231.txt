This is a 46-year-old Black male who primarily speaks German and has been receiving care at our clinic since April 21, 1997. He presents today for a follow-up visit concerning his ongoing issues with asthma.

**Subjective:**
The patient reports an exacerbation of his asthma symptoms over the past week, especially pronounced at night. He describes experiencing significant shortness of breath, wheezing, and a persistent cough that has become moderately severe. Despite the use of his inhaled corticosteroids and short-acting beta-agonist inhaler as required, relief has been partial. He also notes an increase in fatigue but denies any recent upper respiratory infections or exposure to known allergens.

This individual has a long history of asthma, which has necessitated several changes to his medication regimen. His current medications include inhaled corticosteroids, a short-acting beta agonist for emergency use, and a leukotriene receptor antagonist. He adheres to his medication schedule diligently but continues to complain of nocturnal symptoms that disrupt his sleep.

Past medical history is significant for asthma, osteoarthritis, and previous patellar dislocation, which required surgical intervention. 

In terms of his social history, the patient is a non-smoker, does not consume alcohol, and denies drug use. He works as a software engineer and remarks that workplace stress might be aggravating his asthma. He lives alone and leads a predominantly sedentary way of life.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His symptoms include shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing, primarily worsening at night. These have been persistent for the past week, fluctuating from moderate to severe, temporarily alleviated by his rescue inhaler.

He has employed non-pharmacological interventions such as using a humidifier and keeping windows shut during the allergy season, yet these have been of limited benefit. He has not experienced major side effects from his medications but notes a slight exacerbation of symptoms since his last consultation. 

**Objective:**
- **Vital Signs:** Blood Pressure: 128/84 mmHg | Heart Rate: 80 bpm | Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute | Temperature: 98.6Â°F | Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air.
- **General Appearance:** The patient appears well-groomed and is not in acute distress.
- **Cardiovascular:** Heart rate is regular with normal S1 and S2 sounds. There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, and no jugular venous distension or peripheral edema.
- **Respiratory:** There are bilateral wheezes on auscultation, with a noticeably prolonged expiratory phase. There are no crackles or rhonchi, but mild intercostal retractions are present.
- **Abdomen:** The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with normal bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
- **Musculoskeletal:** The patient displays a normal range of motion and strength in all extremities, with no swelling or tenderness in the joints.
- **Neurological:** The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II through XII are intact, and both motor and sensory examinations are within normal limits.
- **Skin:** The skin demonstrates normal texture and color, without any rashes, lesions, or cyanosis.

**Laboratory Data:**
Review of recent laboratory tests indicates normal eosinophil counts but an elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), suggesting systemic inflammation. Hematological parameters, including Hemoglobin (HGB), Hematocrit (HCT), and White Blood Cell (WBC) counts, remain within normal ranges.

**Assessment:**
The primary diagnosis continues to be persistent asthma, with symptoms suggesting a nocturnal variant potentially aggravated by workplace stress. Secondary concerns involve suspected allergic triggers potentially contributing to recent asthma exacerbations.

**Plan:**
1. **Asthma Management:**
   - Continue with current inhaled corticosteroid and short-acting beta-agonist regimen.
   - Increase the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids.
   - Initiate a trial of a long-acting beta-agonist inhaler.
   - Schedule pulmonary function tests to assess the degree of airway obstruction.

2. **Symptom Monitoring and Management:**
   - Maintain a symptom diary to identify potential asthma triggers.
   - Encourage the use of non-pharmacological measures such as an air filtration system.

3. **Referrals:**
   - Refer to a pulmonologist for comprehensive asthma management.
   - Consider allergy testing to identify specific allergens contributing to asthma symptoms.

4. **Education:**
   - Instruct the patient in proper inhaler technique and emphasize the importance of adherence to prescribed medications.
   - Advise the patient to seek urgent care if symptoms escalate to severe respiratory distress or if there is no improvement.

**Follow-Up:**
- The patient is advised to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results necessitate further evaluation.
- Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to reassess asthma control and modify the treatment plan as needed.
- Ensure the patient understands and is agreeable to the treatment plan.
