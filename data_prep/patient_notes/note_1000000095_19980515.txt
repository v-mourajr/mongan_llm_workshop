### Subjective:
This is a 42-year-old Indian male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 8 months, presenting today for a follow-up visit related to his primary diagnosis of asthma. The patient speaks German and reports a worsening of his respiratory symptoms over the past week, characterized by increased wheezing and dyspnea, especially at night.

He has a known history of asthma, which has been generally managed with an as-needed albuterol inhaler, but he has noticed less relief with its use recently. The patient's medical history also includes previous incidences of pneumonia, pulmonary eosinophilia, fractures of the radius and humerus, and osteoarthrosis involving the upper arm. There are no known drug allergies.

The patient also reports generalized joint pain and stiffness likely related to his osteoarthrosis, which has been a recurrent issue. He has not sustained any new fractures since his last visit. 

He is currently taking the following medications: 
   - Albuterol inhaler, as needed for asthma.
   - Over-the-counter NSAIDs for osteoarthrosis-related pain.

From a social standpoint, he lives with his spouse and two children, does not smoke, and denies alcohol or drug use. He is employed as an engineer, and his asthma has sporadically impacted his ability to perform strenuous activities at work.

### Objective:
**Vital Signs:**
- Blood Pressure: 130/85 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 88 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths/min
- Temperature: 98.5Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air

**General Appearance:**
The patient appears well-nourished and in mild respiratory distress. He is alert and oriented.

**Cardiovascular:**
Heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No edema is present.

**Respiratory:**
Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing more pronounced in the upper lobes. Mild intercostal retractions are noted. There are no rales or rhonchi.

**Abdomen:**
Soft, non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly. Bowel sounds are normal.

**Musculoskeletal:**
Examination of the upper extremities shows no deformities or signs of new fractures. Mild crepitus present in the shoulders, reflective of osteoarthrosis. Range of motion is somewhat restricted.

**Neurological:**
Intact, no focal deficits noted.

**Skin:**
No rashes, bruising, or lesions observed.

### Assessment:
The patient presents with exacerbation of his asthma, likely due to recent environmental triggers or non-adherence to daily preventative treatment. There is also a stable history of respiratory and musculoskeletal conditions including previous fractures and pneumonia, as well as osteoarthrosis.

### Plan:
1. **Asthma Management:**
   - Increase albuterol inhaler use to 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed.
   - Initiate a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for daily use to manage chronic inflammation (e.g., fluticasone).
   - Educate the patient on proper inhaler technique and adherence to the daily ICS regimen.
   - Provide a peak flow meter to monitor asthma control, with instructions to log daily results.
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to reassess asthma control and lung function.

2. **Osteoarthrosis Management:**
   - Continue NSAIDs as needed for pain management.
   - Recommend physical therapy to improve joint function and reduce stiffness.
   - Discuss potential benefits of a rheumatology referral if symptoms persist.

3. **General Care:**
   - Review lab work including liver function tests (ALT, AST) and complete blood count (CBC) to monitor any potential abnormalities related to his medication use.
   - Provide educational materials on avoiding asthma triggers, including environmental allergens and respiratory irritants.

### Follow-Up:
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed. Ensure the patient understands the treatment plan and the importance of compliance to avoid future exacerbations. Follow-up in 4 weeks for reassessment of asthma control and overall health.
