This is a 22-year-old White female who has been receiving care at our clinic. She speaks German and presents today, August 26, 2004, for a routine follow-up visit. The patient has a known history of asthma, classified as unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus, and previous reports of recurrent asthma-related episodes, particularly during seasons with high allergen exposure.

Subjective:
The patient reports that since her last visit, she continues to experience episodic shortness of breath and wheezing, which are more pronounced at night and with physical exertion. She has used her rescue inhaler more frequently during the pollen season but has not had any asthma-related hospitalizations or emergency room visits recently. She mentions that her inhaled medication regimen provides relief, but she has noticed a reduction in its effectiveness when allergen exposure is high. She denies taking any herbal supplements and does not have any known allergies.

Her past medical history also includes diagnoses of allergic rhinitis triggered by pollen and other nonspecific allergens, which exacerbate her asthma symptoms. Additionally, she complains of recurring pain in the shoulder and cervical regions, rated 4 out of 10 in intensity, described as a dull ache aggravated by heavy activity. She has a history of abrasions on the elbows and forearms from previous injuries, which have healed completely. 

Socially, she is a student living at home in a smoke-free environment. She does not drink alcohol, smoke, or use any illicit drugs. She mentions feeling stressed due to academic pressures but finds some relief through hobbies like music and reading.

Objective:
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 110/70 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 78 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.4Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

General Appearance:
The patient appears well-nourished, alert, and in no acute distress.

Cardiovascular:
The cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

Respiratory:
On respiratory examination, the lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with the exception of mild end-expiratory wheezing on forced exhalation. There was no use of accessory muscles or retractions noted.

Abdomen:
The abdomen was soft and non-tender, with normoactive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.

Musculoskeletal:
Musculoskeletal examination revealed no acute swelling or erythema of the joints. There was palpable tenderness over the left shoulder and cervical region, and her range of motion was slightly reduced due to pain but did not present significant limitations.

Neurological:
Neurological examination was unremarkable with grossly intact cranial nerves II-XII and no focal deficits.

Skin:
The skin examination did not reveal any new rashes or lesions. Healed abrasion sites on the elbows and forearms were noted, without signs of infection or irritation.

Assessment:
The patient's primary diagnosis is asthma, which is generally well-controlled with her current medication regimen consisting of a long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid. However, her asthma symptoms, exacerbated by allergic rhinitis primarily due to pollen and other allergens, require close monitoring, especially in the allergy season. She also has musculoskeletal pain in the shoulder and cervical regions likely aggravated by her academic stress.

Plan:
1. Asthma:
   - Continue the current management plan with long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid.
   - Encourage the regular use of a rescue inhaler as needed.
   - Schedule pulmonary function tests to reassess baseline lung function and adjust treatment if necessary.
   - Recommend flu vaccination and discuss strategies to reduce allergen exposure during peak seasons.

2. Allergic Rhinitis:
   - Advise continuing antihistamines as needed for symptom control.
   - Consider referral to an allergist if symptoms remain uncontrolled or significantly impact her quality of life.

3. Cervicalgia and Shoulder Pain:
   - Continue physical therapy exercises focusing on strengthening and stretching.
   - Recommend the use of NSAIDs on an as-needed basis for pain relief.
   - Consider referral to an orthopedic specialist if pain persists or worsens despite current measures.

4. General Health:
   - Recommend lifestyle modifications to manage academic stress, including relaxation techniques.
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in three months or sooner if the patient experiences new or worsening symptoms.

The patient has been instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is necessary. She understands and agrees with the proposed plan.
