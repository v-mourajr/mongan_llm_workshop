This is a 58-year-old Indian female who has been receiving care at our clinic for several years. She speaks English fluently and presented today, April 6, 2004, for a follow-up visit to manage her asthma, which is primarily characterized as general asthma without mention of status asthmaticus. 

The primary reason for today’s visit is the recent worsening of asthma symptoms, particularly nocturnal coughing episodes disrupting her sleep. She notes that she has not had any recent upper respiratory infections, and she continues to use a humidifier at night, which only provides marginal relief. Additionally, she is concerned about mild abdominal discomfort, likely connected to her history of gynecological conditions. She has been consistently using her albuterol inhaler as prescribed but denies any use of other home remedies or over-the-counter treatments.

The patient has a significant medical history of cervicitis, endometriosis of the uterus, leiomyomas, hypopotassemia, and a total abdominal hysterectomy. She also has a history of extrinsic asthma, allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock due to food additives, and a depressive disorder. Her current medication regimen includes an albuterol rescue inhaler, a potassium supplement, Allegra-D for allergies, Zoloft for depression, Garamycin for infections, and Zantac for esophageal reflux. She reports no known allergies to medications.

Socially, she is a non-smoker, does not drink alcohol, and lives a relatively sedentary lifestyle due to her health issues. She is married with two grown children and works in a sedentary job.

On physical examination, the patient’s vital signs are reassuring: Blood Pressure 118/72 mmHg, Heart Rate 76 bpm, Respiratory Rate 18 breaths/min, Temperature 98.7°F, and Oxygen Saturation 97% on room air. She appears well-nourished and in no apparent distress.

Cardiovascular examination reveals clear heart sounds with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. Respiratory examination shows clear lungs bilaterally without any wheezing, rales, or use of accessory muscles. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination shows no signs of joint swelling or deformities, and she has full range of motion in all extremities. Neurologically, she is alert and oriented to person, place, and time, with intact cranial nerves and normal motor strength. Her skin examination is unremarkable, showing no signs of rashes or lesions.

Laboratory tests reveal normal albumin and aspartate aminotransferase levels, normal blood urea nitrogen, and continuing low serum potassium, consistent with hypopotassemia.

**Assessment:**
 
1. Asthma, unspecified: The patient's asthma is fairly stable with her current medications, though her nocturnal symptoms suggest a need for further management.

2. Gynecological conditions (leiomyomas, endometriosis, cervicitis): Her postoperative and prior management plans seem effective, with her current symptoms appearing stable.

3. Hypopotassemia: Continued management with potassium supplements is essential.

**Plan:**
 
1. For Asthma:
   - The patient should continue using the albuterol inhaler as needed.
   - Initiate a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) to help control nocturnal asthma symptoms.
   - Continue using the humidifier at night.
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to reassess asthma control and adjust management as needed.
   
2. For Gynecological Conditions:
   - No immediate new interventions required; continue existing postoperative care.
   - Continue with scheduled follow-ups with the gynecologist and monitor for any new symptoms.
   
3. For Hypopotassemia:
   - Continue with the current regimen of potassium supplements.
   - Plan for follow-up blood work to monitor potassium levels at the next visit.
   
**Follow-Up:**
 
The patient has been instructed to contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if laboratory tests indicate a need for further evaluation. Additionally, a follow-up appointment has been scheduled in one month to monitor asthma management and to recheck serum potassium levels.

**Patient Education & Understanding of the Plan:**
 
A detailed discussion was held regarding the significance of adhering to the asthma treatment regimen, recognizing the symptoms of low potassium, and the necessity of following the prescribed medications. The patient verbalized understanding of the plan and importance of monitoring her symptoms closely. She agreed to the proposed plan and demonstrated understanding of the instructions.
