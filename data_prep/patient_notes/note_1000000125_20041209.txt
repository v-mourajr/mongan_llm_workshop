Subjective:
This is a 28-year-old Indian female, who speaks German, presenting today for a follow-up appointment regarding her asthma management. The patient has experienced frequent episodes of shortness of breath and wheezing, primarily nocturnal and triggered by physical exertion and dust exposure. Over the past week, she notes a slight worsening of these symptoms. She has a history of asthma, with no mention of status asthmaticus, and has been managing her condition with a short-acting beta-agonist (albuterol) inhaler, which provides temporary relief.

The patient's past medical history is significant for asthma without complications and recurrent gallbladder issues, including cholecystitis without obstruction and previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She has also been treated for contact dermatitis and unspecified neurotic disorder. Medications include her albuterol inhaler used as needed, Actiq for pain management, and previous administration of cefazolin sodium for infections.

Socially, the patient is a non-smoker living in an urban high air pollution environment, which may exacerbate her symptoms. She works in an office environment and is not involved in regular physical exercise. She has no known drug or environmental allergies. Symptoms are typically worse in the evening, lasting several hours and aggravated by physical activity. They are alleviated somewhat by the use of her inhaler and resting in a cooler environment. The patient has been using a humidifier at night and avoiding known asthma triggers. No recent hospitalizations or emergency room visits have occurred, but there is a slight worsening of symptoms over the past week.

Objective:
- Vital Signs:
    - Blood Pressure: 120/80 mmHg
    - Heart Rate: 78 bpm
    - Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
    - Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
    - Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air
- General Appearance:
    The patient appears well and in no acute distress but seems slightly anxious about her symptoms.
- Cardiovascular:
    Normal heart sounds with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs detected.
- Respiratory:
    Lung examination reveals bilateral wheezing, more prominent on expiration. There is no use of accessory muscles and no signs of cyanosis.
- Abdomen:
    Soft, non-tender, with no organomegaly or masses detected.
- Musculoskeletal:
    Normal range of motion with no joint swelling or tenderness.
- Neurological:
    Alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact, and motor and sensory exams are normal.
- Skin:
    No rashes, lesions, or other abnormalities observed.

Assessment:
The patient’s asthma remains under unspecified control, with recent exacerbations likely triggered by environmental factors and physical exertion. She also has a history of gallbladder issues, including recurrent cholecystitis and previous gallstone removal, as well as contact dermatitis and possibly a neurotic disorder.

Plan:
- Increase the use of the short-acting beta-agonist (albuterol) inhaler to every 4-6 hours as needed for symptoms.
- Introduce a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for daily use to reduce inflammation and prevent frequent exacerbations.
- Conduct a peak flow meter test to monitor expiratory flow rates and consider a referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation.
- Provide patient education on avoiding known triggers and guidelines for using inhalers effectively.
- Advise the patient to maintain a symptom diary to track occurrences and details of each asthma episode.
- Conduct liver function tests and monitor results given the history of liver-related issues such as hepatitis and abnormal results from previous liver function studies.

Follow-Up:
- Instruct patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed.
- Schedule a follow-up visit in 3-4 weeks to assess response to treatment and make necessary adjustments.
- Educate the patient on the importance of adherence to the prescribed medication regimen and the correct use of inhalers. She voiced understanding and agreed to monitor her symptoms closely and return for a follow-up visit as planned.
