This is a 10-year-old Asian male who has been a patient in our clinic since November 28, 2003. He speaks English and presented today, October 22, 2007, for a follow-up visit. He has a primary diagnosis of asthma that includes both status asthmaticus and unspecified asthma without mention of status. His secondary diagnoses include abnormal chest sounds, acute bronchiolitis due to RSV, acute bronchitis, and common cold symptoms. He also has a history of acute conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, and various newborn respiratory and growth issues. 

The patient's mother notes that he has been experiencing mild nasal congestion and a sore throat for the past three days, suggesting a common cold. He was born prematurely and faced several early life health challenges, including neonatal jaundice and respiratory distress syndrome. Despite this, he has made considerable progress in managing symptoms and growth issues with dietary support and medication compliance.

Current medications include Albuterol for asthma, Aveeno cream for occasional skin issues, and parenteral nutritional support with Hepatamine Amino Acids and Liposyn II for failure to thrive.

**Objective:**

- Vital Signs:
  - Blood Pressure: 100/60 mmHg
  - Heart Rate: 92 beats per minute
  - Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute
  - Temperature: 99.1°F
  - Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

The patient appeared well-nourished, hydrated, and in no acute distress. Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular heart rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Respiratory assessment showed clear breath sounds bilaterally without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. The abdominal exam was soft and non-tender with no hepatosplenomegaly. He demonstrated full range of motion in all extremities without deformities. Neurological assessment found him alert and oriented to age, with normal reflexes and no focal deficits. His skin showed no rashes or lesions.

Recent laboratory tests indicated stable levels of electrolytes, arterial blood gases, and no acute anemia or infections. His bilirubin levels have normalized post follow-up assessments.

**Assessment:**

The patient’s primary clinical issues remain centered on respiratory health. He currently presents with acute nasopharyngitis, which is managed conservatively. Key chronic issues include asthma with both status asthmaticus and unspecified type, which is well controlled. Historical conditions such as preterm birth complications, neonatal jaundice, candidiasis, and anemia are stable under his current regimen.

**Plan:**

1. Continue current medication: Albuterol for asthma management and Aveeno cream as needed.
2. Provide supportive care for common cold: Encourage hydration, rest, and symptomatic relief through over-the-counter medications.
3. Maintain parenteral nutritional support with Hepatamine Amino Acids as per dietary needs to manage past failure to thrive.
4. Schedule follow-up in one month to review general health, nutritional status, and address any new concerns.
5. Educate the patient's mother on watching for signs that may require immediate medical consultation, such as increased difficulty breathing, persistent high fever, or worsening symptoms.
6. Ensure the mother understands the importance of continued adherence to dietary and nutritional care plans to prevent complications.

**Follow-Up:**

Instruct the patient’s mother to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week or if any new concerns arise. Emphasize the need for routine health monitoring and dietary adherence to manage ongoing health needs effectively. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in four weeks to reassess his health and development progress.
