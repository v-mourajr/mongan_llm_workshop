This is a 38-year-old White male who has been receiving care at our clinic for a number of years. He speaks English and presents today, January 11, 2010, for follow-up of his asthma management.

The patient’s chronic asthma has been problematic, manifesting as frequent episodes of wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath, predominantly during the night and early morning. Despite his adherence to inhaled corticosteroids and the use of a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for symptomatic relief, he describes his asthma symptoms as recently worsening. He finds that while his SABA inhaler provides some temporary alleviation, it is no longer sufficient.

The patient has a notable medical history of chronic asthma, chronic pharyngitis, chronic sinusitis, abnormal weight loss, and episodes of dyspnea. He does not have a history of surgical interventions. His lifestyle is generally healthy; he reports no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. He works as a graphic designer and is not exposed to occupational respiratory hazards. Living alone, he has no difficulty managing daily activities. He uses an air purifier and minimizes contact with known allergens, yet his symptoms remain disruptive, particularly during sleep.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-groomed, without distress, and is oriented to person, time, and place. His vital signs are stable: Blood Pressure 120/80 mmHg, Heart Rate 78 bpm, Respiratory Rate 18 breaths/min, Temperature 98.6°F, and Oxygen Saturation at 98% on room air.

- **Cardiovascular:** Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
- **Respiratory:** Notable are bilateral expiratory wheezes. Mild intercostal retractions are seen on deep inhalation, but no crackles or rhonchi are present.
- **Abdomen:** Abdomen is soft and non-tender, with normal bowel sounds auscultated.
- **Musculoskeletal:** Displays full range of motion in all joints, without deformities or tenderness.
- **Neurological:** Neurological evaluation is normal with intact cranial nerves II-XII and motor strength 5/5 in all extremities.
- **Skin:** Skin examination is unremarkable with normal turgor and no rashes or lesions.

Recent laboratory evaluations, including a complete blood count (CBC) with assessments for hemoglobin, hematocrit, and total cell counts, are all within normal limits.

The primary clinical impression is chronic asthma, unspecified without status asthmaticus, which appears to be exacerbated, possibly related to environmental factors or the current medication regimen being insufficient. Secondary diagnoses include his history of chronic pharyngitis, chronic sinusitis, abnormal weight loss, and recurrent dyspnea.

The management plan involves adjusting his asthma treatment by increasing the dosage of his inhaled corticosteroid and adding a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) to his daily regimen. We will provide detailed instruction on proper inhaler technique and stress the importance of avoiding known asthma triggers where possible. A follow-up appointment is set for one month from today to reassess his symptoms and the effectiveness of these adjustments. Spirometry will be performed to better understand his lung function and response to treatment. Should there be no significant improvement or if symptoms worsen, a referral to pulmonology will be considered. The patient is encouraged to maintain a daily diary of his peak expiratory flow rates to monitor his condition closely and to detect early signs of exacerbation.

Instruct the patient to contact the clinic should his symptoms fail to improve or continue to worsen within a week. Further, if test results indicate the need, more immediate follow-up will be arranged. Reinforce the importance of adherence to the medication regimen and proper use of inhalers. Emphasis is placed on ensuring the patient fully understands and agrees to the plan of care.
