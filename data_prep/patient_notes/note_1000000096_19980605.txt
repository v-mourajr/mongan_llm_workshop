This 65-year-old Black female, who has been receiving care at our clinic for a little over a year, presented for a follow-up visit on June 5th, 1998. She primarily speaks Spanish and came to discuss her ongoing health concerns, which are predominantly related to her diagnosed conditions, including asthma, depressive disorders, a history of a past myocardial infarction, unspecified neurotic disorder, lack of coordination, and cataract.

**Subjective**  
The patient reports persistent respiratory difficulties, specifically wheezing and shortness of breath, particularly noticeable in the early mornings and late evenings. She feels that her current asthma management regimen is somewhat effective but not fully controlling her symptoms as well as before, leading to frequent use of her rescue inhaler. She also shares feelings of sadness and a lack of motivation that have been increasingly bothersome over the last few weeks. These depressive symptoms are compounded by a constant sense of worry and occasional panic attacks, which she attributes to her diagnosed conversion disorder and general anxiety. Additionally, she mentions difficulty with coordinating movements and vague discomfort in her upper arm joints, hindering daily activities.

The patient currently takes an albuterol inhaler for asthma and sertraline for her depressive disorder. She has been compliant with her medication regimen but noticed no significant improvement in her symptoms. She denies any smoking history and lives alone, engaging infrequently with friends or community due to her depressive state.

**Objective**  
Vital signs observed today include a blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, temperature of 98.6Â°F, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on ambient air. 

Upon physical examination, the patient appears tired and anxious but in no acute distress. Jugular venous pressure is normal, and there is no peripheral edema observed. Cardiac examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm without any audible murmurs or gallops. Lung auscultation is significant for bilateral wheezes and prolonged expiratory phase. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and with normal bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination reveals limited range of motion in both shoulders, without obvious swelling or tenderness. Neurological examination is unremarkable except for mild dysmetria during finger-to-nose testing, indicating slight coordination issues. Her skin shows no lesions or rashes.

Recent laboratory results highlight slight variations in eosinophil count and elevated ESR, which may correlate with her ongoing inflammatory airway disease. Basic metabolic panel is within normal limits.

**Assessment**  
The primary clinical impression is chronic asthma, complicated by insufficient symptom control. Concurrent major depressive disorder and conversion disorder further complicate her management. Secondary issues include a past myocardial infarction, chronic lack of coordination, and non-severe upper arm joint disorder.

**Plan**  
1. **Asthma:** 
   - Increase inhaled corticosteroid dosage and add leukotriene receptor antagonist to enhance control.
   - Reinforce asthma action plan and proper inhaler technique.
   - Schedule spirometry to assess current lung function.
2. **Depressive Disorder and Conversion Disorder:** 
   - Continue sertraline but consider psychiatric referral for comprehensive evaluation and potential adjustment of medication.
   - Schedule follow-up with mental health services for psychotherapy.
3. **Upper Arm Joint Disorder and Coordination Issues:**
   - Encourage physical therapy for shoulder exercises and coordination improvement.
   - Follow-up in one month to assess joint mobility and coordination progress.
4. **Follow-Up Care:** 
   - Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if respiratory symptoms exacerbate, depression symptoms intensify, or new symptoms emerge.
   - Schedule a follow-up visit in one month to review asthma control, mental health status, and physical therapy progress.

During this visit, the patient was educated about the significance of adherence to her medication regimen and provided with information regarding relaxation techniques to alleviate anxiety. She demonstrates understanding of the plan and agrees to the outlined interventions.
