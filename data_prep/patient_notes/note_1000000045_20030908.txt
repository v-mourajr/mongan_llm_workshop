    - Issue/Problem/Request 1:
        Assessment:
            - Likely exacerbation of chronic obstructive asthma.
            - Differential diagnosis includes respiratory infections or cardiac-related dyspnea.
        Diagnostic Tests:
            - Pulmonary function tests, chest X-ray, and arterial blood gases if indicated.
        Treatment Plan:
            - Continue current inhalers, consider adding a corticosteroid inhaler.
            - Prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids.

            - Coronary artery disease with increased chest symptoms.
            - Differential diagnosis includes worsening angina or coronary artery disease.
        Diagnostic Tests:
            - Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes.
        Treatment Plan:
            - Continue current cardiac medications, increase frequency of nitroglycerin during symptomatic periods.
            - Schedule follow-up with cardiology for re-evaluation.

    - Issue/Problem/Request 3:
        Assessment:
            - Chronic back pain secondary to osteoarthritis.
            - Differential diagnosis includes spondylosis or other musculoskeletal disorders.
        Diagnostic Tests:
            - Lumbar spine X-ray.
        Treatment Plan:
