**Subjective:**
This is a 24-year-old Asian male who has been under our clinic's regular care for asthma management for approximately six years. He primarily communicates in Spanish and presents today for a routine follow-up evaluation. The patient states that while his asthma symptoms have generally been stable, he has experienced occasional episodes of shortness of breath and wheezing, especially during physical exertion. These symptoms have been manageable with his albuterol inhaler. He also reports an uptick in his seasonal allergy symptoms, which he believes may be contributing to his respiratory complaints.

His past medical history is significant for asthma, both of unspecified and extrinsic types. He has a history of cardiac dysrhythmias, including paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, for which he previously underwent catheter ablation. Currently, he uses an albuterol inhaler as needed and is receiving allergy immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis. 

He denies the use of herbal supplements and has had no recent surgeries besides the previous cardiac procedures. Socially, he is a college student living with roommates and partakes in recreational sports. He denies smoking, alcohol consumption, or recreational drug use. He has no known drug allergies.

**Objective:**

  - Blood Pressure: 118/76 mmHg
  - Heart Rate: 72 bpm
  - Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
  - Temperature: 98.6°F
  - Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

- **General Appearance:**
  Patient appears well-nourished, in no apparent distress, and is alert and oriented to time, place, and person.

- **Cardiovascular:**
  Regular heart rate and rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, or signs of heart failure noted.

- **Respiratory:**
  Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi detected. No use of accessory muscles or nasal flaring observed. Good air movement on auscultation.

- **Abdomen:**
  Abdomen is soft, non-tender, without distension. Normal bowel sounds heard.

- **Musculoskeletal:**
  Full range of motion in all extremities. No joint deformities, tenderness, or swelling. Specifically, no signs of recurrent shoulder dislocation.

- **Neurological:**
  Cranial nerves II-XII intact. No focal neurological deficits. Patient is alert and oriented.

- **Skin:**
  Skin is intact with good turgor. No rashes or lesions observed.

**Assessment:**
- **Asthma:** The patient’s asthma appears to be under good control with his as-needed albuterol inhaler, though he reports occasional exacerbations likely triggered by seasonal allergies.
- **Cardiac Dysrhythmia:** The patient has a history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, currently asymptomatic post-catheter ablation.
- **Allergic Rhinitis:** Increase in symptoms noted, likely contributing to the recent asthma exacerbations.

**Plan:**
1. **Asthma:**
   - Continue albuterol inhaler as needed.
   - Consider starting an inhaled corticosteroid to further control symptoms if they persist or worsen.
   - Review and reinforce the asthma action plan and proper inhaler technique.
   - No immediate additional diagnostic tests or referrals needed at this time.

2. **Allergic Rhinitis:**
   - Continue with allergy immunotherapy.
   - Recommend over-the-counter antihistamines as needed.
   - Advise the patient on environmental controls to reduce allergen exposure.
   - Follow-up in one month to reassess.

3. **Cardiac Management:**
   - Continue to monitor for any recurrence of symptoms related to dysrhythmias.
   - No new immediate interventions or diagnostic tests needed as the patient remains asymptomatic.

**Follow-Up:**
- Patient is instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen, do not improve within a week, or if breathing difficulties arise.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to reassess the asthma and allergic rhinitis.
- Patient was provided with education on the importance of medication adherence, environmental control measures for allergies, and recognizing early signs of asthma exacerbation. The patient demonstrated understanding and agreed to the management plan.
