This is a 21-year-old Asian male who primarily communicates in Spanish. He has been receiving care at our clinic for an extended period and is here for a follow-up appointment. The main reason for today’s visit is to address ongoing musculoskeletal issues, evaluate previous injuries, and review his overall health status.

Subjective:
The patient reports intermittent cervical and lumbar spine pain associated with a history of an unspecified back injury. He describes the pain as a dull ache that intensifies with prolonged physical activity and is alleviated by rest, ice application, and over-the-counter analgesics. He is active in sports, particularly soccer, and occasionally experiences knee pain, which he manages conservatively. No recent incidents of acute laryngitis or pharyngitis have been noted. He also reports mild tension headaches that occur sporadically and resolve with rest.

The patient’s medical history includes multiple fractures in the carpal and radius bones, which have healed without complications. There is also a history of an uncomplicated open lip wound and minor knee and back sprains. A past incidence of acute alcoholic intoxication is noted; however, the patient currently abstains from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit substances. His support system at home and within his educational environment remains strong, which aids in managing his specific developmental learning difficulties.

He is not on any prescribed medications or supplements and maintains proper hygiene to manage mild acne.
