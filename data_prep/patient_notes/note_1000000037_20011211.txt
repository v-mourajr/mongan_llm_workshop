This is an 11-year-old Indian male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 4 years. He speaks English and presents today for a follow-up visit concerning his asthma management. His condition, diagnosed as unspecified asthma without mention of status asthmaticus, has seen a worsening of symptoms over the past several weeks. The patient’s guardian reports that, although there has been adherence to the inhaled corticosteroid regimen, the patient has experienced increased episodes of nocturnal cough, shortness of breath with physical activity, and a higher frequency of rescue inhaler use.

The patient’s medical history includes asthma, acute upper respiratory infections, and an episode of cystic fibrosis without mention of meconium ileus. Recently, he has also experienced other respiratory abnormalities such as dyspnea. The patient’s asthma has been managed with albuterol and inhaled corticosteroids, though symptoms persist, particularly nocturnally. There have been no known allergies reported by the guardian.

Socially, the patient lives in an urban environment where he is exposed to secondhand smoke within the home, despite attempts to reduce his exposure. He is a school-going child who enjoys playing outdoors but has had to limit these activities due to exacerbations of his asthma.

On physical examination, the patient presents as well-nourished and well-developed without signs of acute distress but appears slightly fatigued. Vital signs were measured as follows: Blood Pressure 110/70 mmHg, Heart Rate 90 bpm, Respiratory Rate 22 breaths per minute, Temperature 98.6°F, and Oxygen Saturation 95% on room air.

In the cardiovascular system, the patient exhibited a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. On respiratory examination, mild intercostal retractions were noted. Breath sounds were decreased bilaterally, with a prolonged expiratory phase and expiratory wheezes present throughout the lung fields. The abdominal exam revealed a soft, non-tender, and non-distended abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds. The musculoskeletal system showed no deformities and full range of motion without discomfort. Neurologically, the patient was alert and oriented with a normal gait. The skin was warm, dry, and intact without rashes or lesions.

Lab results were reviewed, which included normal findings for blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, hemoglobin, and white blood cell count. The urinalysis was unremarkable, showing normal color, specific gravity, and pH levels.

The clinical impression is that the patient's asthma continues to be inadequately controlled, which is likely contributing to his nocturnal symptoms and increased reliance upon his rescue inhaler. The secondhand smoke exposure remains a potential aggravating factor.

The treatment plan involves continuing the current inhaled corticosteroid therapy with careful monitoring to ensure adherence. To address the current exacerbation, the patient will begin a short course of oral corticosteroids. Further reduction of secondhand smoke exposure in the living environment is strongly recommended. The patient and guardian received reinforcement on asthma action plans and proper inhaler techniques, along with the new introduction of daily peak flow meter usage for active monitoring of lung function. 

A follow-up appointment is scheduled in two weeks to reevaluate the patient’s asthma control. Instruction has been given to contact the clinic immediately if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results necessitate further evaluation.

The guardian was educated on emergency symptoms warranting immediate medical attention, such as severe chest tightness, significant dyspnea, or cyanosis. Preventative measures to avoid known asthma triggers, with an emphasis on maintaining a smoke-free, clean environment, were reiterated.
