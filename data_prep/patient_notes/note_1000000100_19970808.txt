Assessment:
    - Diagnosis or Clinical Impression:
        The primary diagnosis remains hypertrophy of adenoids. Given the patient’s chronic symptoms and lack of response to non-pharmacological interventions, continuation of this assessment is necessary.
    - Issue/Problem/Request 1:
        Assessment:
            - Likely diagnosis for Issue 1 is hypertrophy of adenoids.
            - Differential diagnosis includes chronic nasal obstruction due to other causes such as rhinitis or sinusitis.
        Diagnostic Tests:
            - No further diagnostic tests are planned at this time as diagnosis is established; however, review of any imaging studies (if not previously done) may be of benefit.
        Treatment Plan:
            - Considering the persistence and impact on the patient's quality of life, referral to a pediatric otolaryngologist for potential surgical consultation regarding adenoidectomy is warranted.
            - Provide continued monitoring of symptoms and supportive care, including recommending the patient continue using saline nasal sprays and maintain good hydration.

Follow-Up:
    - Instruct patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed.
    - Follow-up with the ENT specialist should be scheduled promptly; the patient should return to the clinic for re-evaluation in 4 weeks or sooner if symptoms escalate.
    - Discuss the treatment plan thoroughly with the patient’s mother, ensuring she understands the next steps and the reasons behind the referral for surgical evaluation.
