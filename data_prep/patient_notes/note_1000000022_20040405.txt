This is a 39-year-old White male who speaks Spanish and has been receiving care at our clinic for several years. He presents today for a follow-up evaluation primarily concerning his asthma, which has been bothering him more frequently lately. The patient reports an increase in the frequency and severity of his asthma attacks over the past month, particularly triggered by cold air and physical exertion. Despite these exacerbations, he denies any recent hospitalizations or emergency room visits for asthma.

His significant medical history includes asthma managed with a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler as needed. He has a past medical history of abscess of the salivary gland, acute pharyngitis, multiple acute upper respiratory infections, alopecia, chronic bronchitis, organic impotence, lumbago, and persistent acne. He also mentioned experiencing a nonspecific swelling in the head and neck area in the past.

The patient is currently using a salbutamol inhaler as needed for asthma and adheres to this regimen. For his back pain secondary to lumbago, he uses over-the-counter ibuprofen, and over-the-counter acne medication for skin issues. He denies the use of herbal supplements.

Socially, he does not smoke or consume alcohol. He works in construction, which he suspects might be contributing to his recent asthma exacerbations. He is married and provides substantial support for his family. The patient has no known allergies. He describes his asthma symptoms as wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness that are relieved with rest and inhaler use. He reports chronic issues of organic impotence managed with hormone therapy. He notes compliance with regular monitoring of prolactin and testosterone levels and adjustments as needed.

**Assessment:**
The patient presents with a history of asthma that appears to be exacerbated by environmental triggers and physical exertion over recent weeks. He also has a history of organic impotence managed with hormone therapy, monitored regularly. Other comorbid conditions include alopecia, chronic bronchitis, lumbago, and acne, all currently stable or managed with symptomatic treatment.

**Plan:**
1. Enhance asthma management by transitioning the patient to a long-term inhaled corticosteroid while continuing the use of the short-acting beta-agonist for acute relief.
2. Educate the patient on proper inhaler technique and avoidance of known asthma triggers, particularly in his occupational environment.
3. Continue monitoring hormone levels for impotence, with adjustments as necessary.
4. Maintain current management practices for alopecia and acne, advising follow-up if symptoms persist or worsen.
5. Recommend physical therapy for lumbago, and continue NSAID use as needed.
6. Advise the patient to return to the clinic if signs of respiratory infection return.
7. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess asthma control and adjust treatment plans accordingly.

**Follow-Up:**
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed. Ensure patient education and understanding of the current plan and the importance of follow-up.
