   - Encourage adherence to dietary recommendations and proper hydration.

2. **Fatigue and Abdominal Discomfort:**
   - Suggest small, frequent meals that are easy to digest, such as whole grains, fruits, and lean proteins.
   - Educate the patient and her parents on identifying and avoiding any potential dietary triggers that might worsen symptoms.
   - Recommend light physical activity as tolerated.

3. **General Health Maintenance:**
   - Ensure continued abstinence from over-the-counter analgesics without medical supervision.
