- Visit Date: 09/28/2004

This is a 14-year-old Indian male who has been under the care of our clinic for approximately 7 years. He speaks English and presents today for a follow-up visit regarding his asthma management. Documented as asthma unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus, his condition has shown increased symptoms recently. Despite compliance with his inhaled corticosteroid regimen, there have been more frequent episodes of nocturnal cough, dyspnea on exertion, and heightened reliance on his rescue inhaler, albuterol.

His medical history is significant for asthma, acute upper respiratory infections, and an incidence of cystic fibrosis without mention of meconium ileus. Respiratory complications such as dyspnea have also been noted. His asthma has been managed primarily with albuterol and inhaled corticosteroids, although symptoms have persisted, predominantly nocturnally. The patient has no known allergies.

Socially, this adolescent resides in an urban setting where he is exposed to secondhand smoke at home despite efforts to minimize his exposure. As a school-going student who enjoys outdoor activities, he has needed to curtail these due to asthma exacerbations. 

**Subjective:**

- Chief Complaints & History of Present Illness: The patient is experiencing increased episodes of nocturnal cough, shortness of breath with physical activity, and a higher frequency of rescue inhaler usage over the past few weeks.
- Medications & Supplements: The patient has been adherent to an inhaled corticosteroid regimen and uses albuterol as needed for acute symptoms.
- Social History: Lives in an urban area with exposure to secondhand smoke within the home, affecting his asthma control.
- Symptom Details: Asthma-related symptoms include nocturnal cough, exertional dyspnea, and increased reliance on rescue inhaler.

**Objective:**

- Vital Signs:
  - Blood Pressure: 110/70 mmHg
  - Heart Rate: 90 bpm
  - Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths per minute
  - Temperature: 98.6Â°F
  - Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air
- General Appearance: The patient appears well-nourished and well-developed but slightly fatigued.
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
- Respiratory: Mild intercostal retractions, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, prolonged expiratory phase with expiratory wheezes throughout lung fields.
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended with normoactive bowel sounds.
- Musculoskeletal: No deformities, full range of motion without discomfort.
- Neurological: Alert and oriented, normal gait.
- Skin: Warm, dry, intact, no rashes or lesions.

Recent lab results have shown normal values for blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, hemoglobin, and white blood cell count. The urinalysis was unremarkable, showing normal color, specific gravity, and pH levels.

**Assessment:**

The patient's asthma remains poorly controlled, contributing to nocturnal symptoms and increased reliance on rescue medication. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a likely aggravating factor.

**Plan:**

1. Continue current inhaled corticosteroid therapy, ensuring strict adherence.
2. Initiate a short course of oral corticosteroids to manage the current exacerbation.
3. Strongly advise further reduction of secondhand smoke exposure at home.
4. Reinforce asthma action plans and proper inhaler techniques.
5. Introduce daily peak flow meter usage for active lung function monitoring.
6. Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks for re-evaluation.

Instructed the patient and guardian to contact the clinic immediately if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results warrant further evaluation. Educated guardian on emergency symptoms that require immediate medical attention, including severe chest tightness, significant dyspnea, or cyanosis. Emphasized preventive measures to avoid known asthma triggers, including maintaining a smoke-free, clean living environment.
