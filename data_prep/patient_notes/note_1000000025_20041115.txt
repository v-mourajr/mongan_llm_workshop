This is a 72-year-old Hispanic female who has been receiving care at our clinic for nearly three years. She speaks Spanish and presents today for follow-up regarding her asthma and other chronic conditions.

Subjective:
The patient reports an increase in her asthma symptoms, with shortness of breath and wheezing becoming more pronounced over the past 48 hours. Despite using her inhaled corticosteroids and albuterol as prescribed, she finds these symptoms persist. She denies any recent infections or alterations in her environment. Her past medical history includes asthma (unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus), brachial neuritis or radiculitis NOS, bronchiectasis, carpal tunnel syndrome, disturbance of skin sensation, hyperhidrosis, and periodic chest pain.

Currently, she takes inhaled corticosteroids, albuterol as needed, Evista for osteoporosis, Lescol for hyperlipidemia, and has had treatments including midazolam hydrochloride in the past. The patient lives alone and is retired, maintaining an overall healthy lifestyle without smoking or alcohol consumption, and stays active through daily walks. She has no known drug allergies. Wheezing is mainly nocturnal while shortness of breath varies throughout the day, exacerbated by activity and partially alleviated with rest and albuterol. She rated her current breathing difficulty at 6 out of 10.

Objective:
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 128/82 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 78 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.4°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 94% on room air

General Appearance: Patient is alert, oriented, mildly dyspneic, but not in acute distress.
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Peripheral pulses are strong bilaterally.
Respiratory: Auscultation reveals diffuse wheezing with a prolonged expiratory phase, and noted use of accessory muscles. There are no rales or rhonchi.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, with normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly.
Musculoskeletal: Mild discomfort in both wrists with a positive Tinel’s sign bilaterally. She retains full range of motion in the extremities.
Neurological: Intact sensation and 5/5 muscle strength throughout.
Skin: Warm, dry, with no visible rashes or signs of cyanosis.

Assessment:
Primary diagnosis remains asthma, currently presenting with an acute exacerbation despite ongoing treatment. Secondary conditions include brachial neuritis or radiculitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, disturbance of skin sensation, hyperhidrosis, and recurring chest pain of unknown origin.

Plan:
1. Asthma exacerbation:
    - Increase dose of inhaled corticosteroids, continue albuterol use as needed, and commence a short course of oral corticosteroids.
    - Referral to pulmonology for more comprehensive assessment and possible adjustment of treatment plan.
    - Consider repeating spirometry to evaluate current pulmonary function.

2. Carpal tunnel syndrome:
    - Suggest nighttime wrist splints and NSAIDs for pain management. 
    - Order electromyography (EMG) for further evaluation.
    - Referral to orthopedics if symptoms do not improve.

3. Chest pain of unspecified origin:
    - Continue monitoring and reassessment, with a repeat electrocardiogram and possible stress test if symptoms persist.
    - If needed, referral to cardiology for detailed evaluation.

Follow-Up: 
The patient is instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or remain unchanged within a week or if test results necessitate further action. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for one week to monitor asthma control and review new diagnostic results. The patient was provided an asthma action plan and expressed understanding of and agreement with the enhanced treatment and follow-up strategy.
