### Subjective:
This is a 10-year-old Black male who presents today for further evaluation and management of his health concerns. The patient has been under our clinic's care for approximately four years and is accompanied by his mother. Both communicate fluently in English.

The patient’s primary complaint today is frequent episodes of pharyngitis, particularly notable for increased frequency over the past two months. The mother states that the patient has had nine sore throats since the onset of winter, typically presenting with throat pain, mild fever, and occasional difficulty swallowing. Symptom relief has been temporarily achieved with over-the-counter acetaminophen, but improvements are short-lived.

Additionally, the patient and mother express concern about recurrent ear infections, characterized by ear pain and discharge over the past year. These episodes have been diagnosed as acute suppurative otitis media and have required several courses of antibiotics. The patient has had varying responses to these treatments, and no significant surgical interventions have been performed in the past.

The patient has also reported bouts of fatigue and decreased enthusiasm for school activities. He demonstrates a stable social environment, living with his supportive family and attending school regularly. The reduced participation is mainly due to his recurrent infections and related symptoms. There have been no notable adverse effects or allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors. There are no records or reports suggesting a history of asthma-related symptoms or treatments.

### Assessment:
- **Pharyngitis (recurrent):**
  Recurrent acute pharyngitis, likely of viral origin given the symptom frequency and clinical presentation.
- **Recurrent Acute Otitis Media:**
  Recurring episodes of acute suppurative otitis media, noting the history of antibiotic treatment with variable response.
- **Fatigue:**
  Fatigue potentially secondary to frequent infections and reduced food intake and rest.

### Plan:
1. **Pharyngitis:**
   - Perform a rapid antigen detection test for streptococcal infection to rule out bacterial etiology.
   - Recommend saline gargles and warm fluids to soothe the throat.
   - Continue acetaminophen for pain and fever as needed, monitoring for any adverse reactions.
   - Referral to an ENT specialist for further evaluation given the frequency of episodes.

2. **Acute Otitis Media:**
   - Prescribe a new course of antibiotics more suited to recent culture sensitivity results.
   - Schedule tympanostomy tube placement discussion with an ENT specialist if infections persist despite medical management.
   - Provide education on ear hygiene and infection prevention techniques.

3. **Fatigue:**
   - Conduct a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for underlying infections or anemia.
   - Encourage a balanced diet rich in iron and vitamins to boost energy levels and overall health.
   - Advise limiting strenuous activities but maintaining moderate, regular physical activities.

4. **Follow-Up:**
   - Instruct the patient and his mother to monitor symptoms and contact the clinic if pharyngitis or otitis media worsen, despite current measures.
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess the patient's progress and adjust the care plan accordingly.
   - Ensure patient and family understand the importance of completing antibiotic courses and provide clear guidance on symptom monitoring and management.

Patient education was emphasized, ensuring understanding and adherence to the proposed treatment and diagnostic plans. Immediate follow-up for any emergent symptoms or changes was advised.
