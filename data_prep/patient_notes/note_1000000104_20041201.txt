This is a 26-year-old Hispanic male who speaks English and has been receiving care at our clinic for asthma management for several months. He presents today, December 1, 2004, for follow-up on his asthma as well as some recent respiratory symptoms.

### Subjective:
The patient reports increased wheezing and shortness of breath over the past two weeks, especially at night. Despite being compliant with his asthma medications—a daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and an albuterol inhaler as needed—he has noticed a need to use the rescue inhaler around 3-4 times daily, which is more frequent than his typical use. Additionally, the patient has a history of acute pharyngitis but has not experienced a sore throat or fever recently.

He denies any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors. He has not traveled recently and reports no exposure to respiratory irritants. He lives with his parents, does not smoke or drink alcohol, and is a college student. He is currently being treated for attention deficit disorder (ADD) without hyperactivity. He is attentive to his oral health and recently underwent a dental examination without any issues.

### Objective:
**Vital Signs:**
- Blood Pressure: 118/76 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 84 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
- Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air

**Physical Examination:**
- **General Appearance:** The patient is well-developed, well-nourished, and in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented.
- **Cardiovascular:** S1 and S2 are present with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
- **Respiratory:** Breath sounds are diminished with expiratory wheezes noted bilaterally. There are no crackles, and the use of accessory muscles is evident.
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, and non-distended with normal bowel sounds and no organomegaly.
- **Musculoskeletal:** Normal range of motion with no deformities or tenderness observed.
- **Neurological:** Alert and oriented, no focal deficits observed.
- **Skin:** No rashes, lesions, or signs of infection.

Recent laboratory results have shown normal bilirubin, glucose, and protein levels, with no abnormalities in urinalysis, including ketones, nitrites, and specific gravity. Hematocrit and white blood cell count are within normal ranges, which rule out any signs of infection or anemia.

### Assessment:
1. **Asthma:** The primary diagnosis of asthma, unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus, remains. The increase in symptom frequency suggests an exacerbation that may necessitate adjustments in the current management plan.
2. **Acute Pharyngitis:** Previously diagnosed but currently resolved, with no active symptoms requiring treatment.
3. **Attention Deficit Disorder:** Currently stable under existing treatment.

### Plan:
1. **Asthma:**
   - Increase the inhaled corticosteroid dosage to improve symptom control.
   - Advise the patient to continue the use of the albuterol inhaler as needed.
   - Recommend home monitoring of peak expiratory flow rates to assess asthma control.
   - Consider referral to a pulmonologist if symptoms persist or worsen within the next week.

2. **Acute Pharyngitis:**
   - No treatment necessary at this time, as there are no active symptoms.

3. **Attention Deficit Disorder:**
   - Continue the current treatment regimen and schedule routine follow-up visits to monitor progress.

**Follow-Up:**
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week. Reinforce the importance of adhering to the asthma management plan and avoiding known triggers. Schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to reassess asthma control and evaluate the efficacy of the adjusted treatment regimen.

**Patient Education & Understanding of the Plan:**
The patient verbalized understanding of the treatment plan, the importance of medication adherence, and the need for follow-up care. He was also advised to maintain good oral hygiene and to continue attending regular dental check-ups.
