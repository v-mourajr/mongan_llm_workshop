This is a 22-year-old Black female who has been receiving care at our clinic for several years. She is a German-speaking patient presenting today, December 10, 2008, for a routine follow-up appointment. The patient has a primary diagnosis of asthma, which has been managed with several asthma-specific medications. Recently, she reports experiencing more frequent episodes of dyspnea and wheezing, particularly during physical exertion. Her use of a prescribed rescue inhaler provides some relief, but not complete resolution of her symptoms.

The patient’s past medical history is significant for asthma, frequent bouts of pneumonia, pulmonary collapse, pleural effusion, and incidents of respiratory distress syndrome. There have been no significant surgeries noted in her history, and she has not reported any known allergies to medications.

Currently, her medication regimen includes Atrovent, Flonase, and Singulair. Despite family efforts to reduce environmental triggers such as dust and cold air, she has noted an increase in symptoms.

Vital signs recorded during her visit were as follows:
- Blood Pressure: 110/68 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 78 beats per minute
- Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.2°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air

During the physical examination, the patient was alert, well-nourished, and appeared to be in no acute distress. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable with a regular heart rhythm and no detectable murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. Respiratory examination revealed a mild expiratory wheeze bilaterally, with diminished breath sounds particularly noted in the lower lung fields. There was no significant use of accessory muscles for breathing. The abdomen was soft and non-tender, without any signs of hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal and neurological examinations were normal. The skin examination revealed no rashes or lesions.

The primary diagnosis for this patient continues to be asthma, unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus. Secondary diagnoses include episodic pulmonary issues such as pulmonary insufficiency, a history of recurrent pneumonia, and previous episodes of pulmonary collapse.

**Plan:**

1. **Asthma Management:**
   - Continue with the current medications of Atrovent, Flonase, and Singulair.
   - Emphasize the importance of strict medication adherence and educate on proper inhaler technique.
   - Consider initiating a short course of oral corticosteroids if her symptoms do not significantly improve.
   - Refer the patient to a pulmonologist for a thorough evaluation of her recurrent pulmonary issues.

2. **Diagnostics:**
   - Order a chest X-ray to further investigate her ongoing respiratory concerns.
   - Schedule pulmonary function tests to assess her asthma control and overall lung function.
   - Perform routine blood tests, including a complete blood count and liver function tests to monitor her overall health and rule out other potential causes of her symptoms.

3. **Follow-Up:**
   - Instruct the patient and her family to vigilantly monitor her symptoms and to promptly report any significant changes or worsening of her condition.
   - Schedule quarterly follow-up visits or more frequently if her symptoms dictate.
   - Advise immediate contact with the clinic should the patient’s symptoms persist or fail to improve within a week.

**Patient Education & Understanding of the Plan:**
The patient and her family were thoroughly educated about the critical role of medication adherence, the early signs of asthma exacerbations, and the importance of following the action plan should symptoms worsen. They confirmed their understanding and concurred with the planned care. The patient is scheduled for a three-month follow-up visit with directives to reach out to the clinic immediately if her symptoms intensify or fail to resolve.
