**Subjective:**
This is a 16-year-old Indian male who has been receiving care at our clinic for nearly a decade, accompanied by his parents, who assist with communication in German. The patient presents today for a scheduled follow-up visit regarding his asthma, which has shown increased activity over the past two weeks. He reports heightened episodes of wheezing and shortness of breath particularly triggered by physical exertion. While his prescribed bronchodilator inhaler has provided some relief, it has been insufficient to fully control his symptoms. Additionally, he mentions experiencing a mild cough and nasal congestion, suggestive of an upper respiratory tract involvement.

His medical history is notable for unspecified asthma without status asthmaticus, adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features, and a benign brain neoplasm. He has also experienced acute pharyngitis, enterobiasis, and otitis media in the past. He is diligent about attending routine health check-ups.

Currently, he is on a bronchodilator inhaler, which he has been using more frequently, and an over-the-counter saline nasal spray. No allergies have been reported. Recently, he sustained a minor injury to his right great toe while playing, which he reports is improving.

**Objective:**
- **Vital Signs:**
  - Blood Pressure: 100/60 mmHg
  - Heart Rate: 88 bpm
  - Respiratory Rate: 26 breaths/min
  - Temperature: 36.8Â°C
  - Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air

- **General Appearance:** The patient appears well-nourished but slightly fatigued, in no acute distress.
- **Cardiovascular:** Normal heart sounds with no murmurs.
- **Respiratory:** Mild intercostal retractions and bilateral expiratory wheezes are noted. Airflow is slightly reduced bilaterally; no crackles or rhonchi present.
- **Abdomen:** Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no organomegaly.
- **Musculoskeletal:** Full range of motion in all extremities. A fading contusion on the right great toe without signs of further trauma or infection.
- **Neurological:** Alert and oriented, no focal neurological deficits.
- **Skin:** No rashes or lesions.

**Assessment:**
1. **Primary Diagnosis:** Asthma, unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus, currently experiencing an exacerbation likely compounded by upper respiratory symptoms.
2. **Secondary Diagnoses:**
   - Adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features, stable.
   - Benign neoplasm of the brain, stable without active symptoms.
3. **Other Clinical Considerations:**
   - Healing contusion on the right great toe.
   - History of resolved enterobiasis, acute pharyngitis, and otitis media.

**Plan:**
1. **Asthma Management:**
   - Begin treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid for daily use while continuing the bronchodilator inhaler as needed.
   - Educate the patient and family on proper inhaler technique and broader asthma management strategies.
   - Implement daily peak flow monitoring to track pulmonary function.
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to assess the efficacy of new treatments. Consider referral to a pediatric pulmonologist if significant improvement is not observed.
   - Advise on reducing exposure to potential asthma triggers in the home and provide relevant educational materials.

2. **Adjustment Disorder:**
   - Continue current supportive management including family involvement and structured activities.

3. **Toe Contusion:**
   - Monitor for any complications; no specific treatment required at this stage.

4. **Preventive Care:**
   - Maintain vigilance for recurrent ear infections. Prompt medical attention should be sought if symptoms recur.
   - Reinforce the importance of regular check-ups and vaccinations.

The patient and his parents have been advised to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen, fail to improve within a week, or if adverse reactions to the new inhaler occur. They have been briefed on the signs of an asthma attack and the importance of adhering to the management plan. The patient and family have acknowledged their understanding. Follow-up has been scheduled for one month.
