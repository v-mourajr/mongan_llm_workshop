This is a 34-year-old Asian male who speaks English and has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately three weeks. He presents today for a follow-up visit primarily concerning his asthma management.

Subjective:
The patient reports an increase in shortness of breath and wheezing over the past three days, which he attributes to recent environmental changes and a mild upper respiratory infection. He indicates that his albuterol inhaler provides temporary relief. His asthma symptoms typically worsen during cold weather and when exposed to dust and smoke. He has a history of pleurisy and pneumonia, leading to prior admissions. Additionally, he mentions episodes of diarrhea, which resolved without intervention.

Past Medical & Surgical History includes diagnosed asthma, a history of pneumonia, and pleurisy without effusion. He has had a routine general medical examination in the past year, noting normal findings.

The patient is currently on albuterol for asthma management, with additional medications for symptom relief. His adherence to the regimen is good, and he has not experienced significant side effects.

Social history reveals that he is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. He resides in an urban area with moderate air pollution, which he believes exacerbates his condition. He actively participates in light physical activities and follows a balanced diet.

He has no known drug allergies. Symptom details include persistent wheezing, shortness of breath on exertion, a mild cough, and occasional chest tightness. Symptoms aggravate during physical activities and exposure to cold air.

   - Prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids to manage the acute flare.

2. Follow-Up Tests:
   - Pulmonary function tests, including vital capacity determination.
   - Repeat chest X-ray to ensure resolution of previous pneumonia.
   - Spirometry to assess current asthma control.

3. Referrals:
   - Referral to a pulmonologist for comprehensive asthma management and evaluation of potential underlying issues contributing to chronic symptoms.

4. Education and Monitoring:
   - Instruct the patient on proper inhaler techniques.
   - Advise avoiding known asthma triggers and monitoring symptoms closely.
   - Inform the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed.

Follow-Up:
   - The patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit in two weeks to reassess asthma control and review test results.
