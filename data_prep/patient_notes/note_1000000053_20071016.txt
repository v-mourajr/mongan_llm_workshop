This is an 11-year-old Asian male who has been receiving care at our clinic since shortly after birth. He speaks Spanish, and his mother accompanies him to assist with communication. The visit today, dated October 16, 2007, is primarily for follow-up management of his asthma and recent exacerbations.

Chief among the mother’s concerns is her child’s persistent coughing and wheezing, primarily nocturnal, which has resulted in disrupted sleep patterns for the past week. She also reports episodes of shortness of breath during any physical exertion. These respiratory symptoms have been exacerbated following a recent illness characterized by a fever and rhinorrhea. Additionally, the boy has been experiencing intermittent skin rashes that appear and disappear without a clear pattern or identifiable triggers.

The patient’s asthma is currently managed with a rescue inhaler (albuterol) as needed and a daily corticosteroid inhaler. Despite adherence to this regimen, there has been no significant improvement in his symptoms.

On examination, the patient’s vital signs are within normal limits for his age, with a blood pressure of 100/65 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, temperature of 98.7°F, and oxygen saturation at 97% on room air.

The patient appears alert, active, and well-nourished, with no signs of acute distress. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds with no murmurs and a regular rhythm. Respiratory examination notes mild respiratory distress with wheezing more pronounced during expiration, intercostal retractions, and decreased breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal and neurological exams are unremarkable, with appropriate age-related behavior and no focal deficits. The skin examination reveals multiple erythematous, raised rashes on the arms and chest, with no signs of secondary infection.

The primary diagnosis is asthma, unspecified, currently without mention of status asthmaticus but presently exacerbated by a recent viral respiratory infection. The patient’s respiratory symptoms align with this diagnosis, although differential diagnoses should include other respiratory conditions contributing to dyspnea. 

Secondary to his asthma, the patient presents with a probable atopic or allergic-related rash, and signs of a viral illness impacting his respiratory status.

The treatment plan includes:
1. Asthma Management: Continue with the current corticosteroid inhaler and albuterol as needed. Introduce a short course of oral corticosteroids to manage this exacerbation. Educate the mother on recognizing early asthma exacerbations and administering medications properly. Follow up in one month to monitor progress and reassess the treatment plan.

2. Diagnostic Testing: Conduct pulmonary function tests to establish baseline respiratory function, adjust long-term management as necessary, and order a complete blood count (CBC) with differential to rule out underlying infections or anemia.

3. Management of Skin Rash: Prescribe topical corticosteroids with instructions for use. Suggest maintaining a diary to identify potential rash triggers.

4. Viral Infection Management: Provide supportive care recommendations, including ample fluids and rest. Advise monitoring for any persistent or worsening symptoms.

5. Patient Education: Discuss environmental trigger reduction at home (e.g., avoiding dust and smoke). Emphasize medication adherence and correct usage.

The mother is instructed to contact the clinic if her son’s symptoms do not improve, worsen, or if test results reveal a need for further evaluation. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for four weeks to reassess his condition and response to this treatment plan. Ensure all aspects of today's consultation and any educational materials provided to the mother are thoroughly documented.
