This is a 45-year-old white male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 11 years. He presents for a follow-up visit on August 28, 2009, primarily concerning his persistent asthma. The patient is a native Spanish speaker and works in construction, which likely contributes to his recent asthma exacerbations. He reports that his asthma attacks have increased in frequency and severity over the past month, particularly triggered by cold air and physical exertion. He denies recent hospitalizations or emergency room visits for asthma exacerbations. This narrative details his current visit and examination.

**Subjective:**
The patient’s significant medical history includes asthma, generalized and multiple sites of abdominal pain, abscess of the salivary gland, acute bronchitis, acute pharyngitis, repeated upper respiratory infections, and allergic rhinitis. Additionally, he has chronic issues like organic impotence, male infertility, unspecified viral infections, bronchitis, hypothyroidism, and lumbago. He also reports alopecia and nonspecific respiratory symptoms, such as a cough and shortness of breath.

Currently, he is managing his asthma with Flovent (an inhaled corticosteroid) and uses a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler for acute relief. He adheres strictly to this regimen. For his back pain due to lumbago, he utilizes over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed. He reports using topical Nizoral for acne treatment episodically. He denies the use of any herbal supplements and has no known allergies. The patient does not smoke or consume alcohol.

He is married and actively supports his family both emotionally and financially, often staying physically active. His asthma symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, which improve with rest and inhaler usage. His impotence, managed with hormone therapy, is regularly monitored, with adjustments made to his prolactin and testosterone levels as necessary.

**Objective:**
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 120/80 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 72 beats per minute
- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.7°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 97% on room air

General Appearance:
The patient is well-developed, well-nourished, and in no acute distress. He is alert, cooperative, and oriented.

Cardiovascular:
Heart rate and rhythm are regular. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs heard.

Respiratory:
On examination, mild expiratory wheezing is noted bilaterally, more pronounced with forced expiration. There are no crackles, rhonchi, or stridor. Symmetrical chest expansion is present.

Abdomen:
The abdomen is soft, non-tender, with present bowel sounds. No organomegaly or palpable masses are detected.

Musculoskeletal:
Mild tenderness upon palpation of the lumbar region is noted without deformities. The full range of motion in all extremities is intact.

Neurological:
The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact with no focal neurological deficits.

Skin:
Patches of hair loss are noted on the scalp, consistent with alopecia. No acute skin lesions or infections observed.

**Assessment:**
The patient presents with persistent asthma exhibiting increased frequency and severity of attacks, likely exacerbated by environmental triggers related to his construction work and physical exertion. Additional chronic conditions include organic impotence managed with hormone therapy, chronic bronchitis, alopecia, lumbago, and acne, all currently stable or managed conservatively.

**Plan:**
1. Enhance asthma management by optimizing the dosage of Flovent and continuing the use of the short-acting beta-agonist inhaler for acute exacerbations.
2. Provide thorough education on proper inhaler technique and strategies to avoid known asthma triggers, particularly in his work environment.
3. Continue monitoring and adjusting hormone levels for impotence management as necessary.
4. Maintain current treatments for alopecia and acne, with advice to seek follow-up should symptoms persist or worsen.
5. Recommend participation in a physical therapy program to better manage lumbago, supplemented by NSAIDs for symptomatic relief.
6. Advise the patient to seek immediate medical attention if signs of respiratory infection or asthma exacerbations occur.
7. Schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to reassess asthma control and adjust treatment as needed.

**Follow-Up:**
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if his symptoms worsen or fail to improve within a week, or if test results indicate the need for further evaluation. Emphasize the importance of the treatment plan and ensure his understanding of the recommendations provided.
