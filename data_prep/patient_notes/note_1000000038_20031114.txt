This is a 26-year-old Asian male who has been under our care since September 15, 1997. He communicates proficiently in English and presents today for follow-up regarding his asthma management.

Subjective:
The patient presents with complaints of increasing shortness of breath, primarily nocturnal exacerbations, and dyspnea on exertion. He describes the frequency of these episodes as gradually intensifying over the past month, leading to heightened reliance on his Albuterol inhaler, which now provides only temporary relief. Additionally, he experiences intermittent wheezing and a persistent dry cough. 

He has a history of asthma, unspecified type, without mention of status asthmaticus. His past medical history is significant for acute bronchitis, upper respiratory infections, and pharyngitis. Injuries within his medical history include an ankle effusion, closed dislocation of a finger, and various other unspecified injuries to the lower extremities including a fracture and a sprain.

Current medications include Albuterol Sulfate 4mg tablets for asthma, which he has used up to four times daily recently, and Desquam-X 10% gel for acne treatment. He reports adherence to these medications without adverse effects. 

As a college student residing in a dormitory, he maintains a non-smoking lifestyle with no alcohol or recreational drug use. He has no known allergic reactions.

The onset of symptom exacerbation was around four weeks ago, with symptoms most prominent at night and triggered by physical activity. He has minimized outdoor activities to reduce allergen exposure but has not found significant relief.

Objective:
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 120/80 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 82 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.6Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air

General Appearance: Patient is alert, well-nourished, and in no acute distress but exhibits mild anxiety, likely attributable to breathing difficulties.

Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with no audible murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Peripheral pulses are equal and strong bilaterally.

Respiratory: Bilateral diminished breath sounds accompanied by expiratory wheezing diffusely. No rales or crackles present. Mild use of accessory muscles observed during respiration.

Abdomen: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended with normoactive bowel sounds in all quadrants.

Musculoskeletal: No visible swelling or deformity in joints; full range of motion. No tenderness noted on palpation of knees, ankles, or feet.

Neurological: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. Motor and sensory examinations show no abnormalities.

Skin: Facial lesions consistent with acne vulgaris; no signs of infection or significant inflammation.

Assessment:
Primary diagnosis is an asthma exacerbation, necessitating a review and adjustment of the current treatment regimen. Contributing factors may include environmental triggers or inadequate control with current pharmacotherapy.

Additionally, the patient has historical lower extremity injuries without current acute manifestations.

Plan:
1. Asthma Management:
- Increase Albuterol inhaler to 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed for acute episodes.
- Introduce a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., Fluticasone) for daily management to reduce chronic airway inflammation and prevent exacerbations.
- Educate the patient on correct inhaler technique and emphasize adherence to the new medication regimen.
- Schedule a follow-up visit in 4 weeks to evaluate asthma control and adjust treatment accordingly.
- Consider allergen testing and possible referral to an allergist.

2. Lower Extremity Issues:
- Maintain current management, including rest, elevation, and supportive footwear as necessary.
- Instruct the patient to return for evaluation if new symptoms or worsening pain or swelling occurs.

3. General Health:
- Reinforce maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle while avoiding known asthma triggers.
- Educate the patient on monitoring for signs of asthma exacerbation and when to seek urgent medical attention.

Follow-Up:
Instruct the patient to closely monitor symptoms and contact the clinic immediately if there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen. A follow-up appointment has been scheduled for 4 weeks to reassess asthma control and overall health.

The patient understands and agrees with the proposed care plan, and educational materials on asthma management and inhaler use have been provided. The patient left the clinic in stable condition, with no immediate distress.
