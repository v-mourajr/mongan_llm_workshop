Subjective:
This is a 24-year-old Asian male who primarily speaks Spanish and has been consistently attending our clinic for his medical needs. He presents today for a follow-up appointment due to ongoing musculoskeletal issues, a comprehensive health evaluation, and management of his known medical conditions. The patient reports experiencing intermittent pain in the cervical and lumbar spine associated with a history of an unspecified back injury. He describes the pain as a dull ache that worsens with prolonged physical activity and improves with rest, application of ice, and the use of over-the-counter pain relievers. Engaging in soccer, he occasionally deals with knee pain, which he manages with conservative measures. He has not had any recent occurrences of acute laryngitis or pharyngitis. However, he does experience mild tension headaches intermittently, which resolve with rest.

His past medical history is notable for multiple healed fractures involving the carpal and radius bones, an uncomplicated open wound on the lip, and minor knee and back sprains. He has also had an episode of acute alcoholic intoxication. Presently, he abstains from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. His support system, including his family and educational environment, remains robust, aiding in the management of his specific developmental learning challenges.

He currently does not take any prescribed medications or supplements and adheres to good hygiene practices to control mild acne.
