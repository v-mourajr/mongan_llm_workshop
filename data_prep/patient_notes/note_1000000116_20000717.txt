Subjective:
    - Chief Complaints & History of Present Illness:
        This is a 6-year-old Black male, who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 10 months. Today, he presents with complaints of cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing which have persisted for the past three days. His mother reports that these symptoms are worse at night and after physical activity. There is no reported fever, but he has had a decreased appetite and increased fatigue. His asthma is typically well-managed with his current medication regimen but has been exacerbated recently.
    - Past Medical & Surgical History:
        The patient has a history of asthma, with previous episodes requiring nebulizer treatments. He also has a medical history of acute nonsuppurative otitis media and has undergone routine circumcision as an infant.
    - Medications & Supplements:
        He is currently taking Albuterol as needed for asthma exacerbations and Fluticasone (daily inhaled corticosteroid) to manage chronic symptoms. His mother ensures the medications are administered as prescribed.
    - Social History:
        The patient lives with his mother and younger sibling in an urban environment. He attends kindergarten and is generally active, though his activities are often limited by his asthma. There is no exposure to tobacco smoke in the home.
    - Allergies:
        No known allergies.
    - Symptom Details:
        The cough and wheezing began abruptly three days ago, mainly occurring at night and following physical exertion. These symptoms have made him more fatigued than usual. No fever has been noted during this period.
    - Additional Narrative:
        The mother has been using the nebulizer at home, which has provided some relief. However, she is concerned about the frequency and severity of the recent asthma exacerbation. There are no new exposures or changes in his routine that might explain the increased symptoms.
