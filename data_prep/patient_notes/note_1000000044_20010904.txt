Subjective:
    This is an 8-year-old Asian male known to our clinic for asthma, presenting today for a follow-up visit. His asthma symptoms have been relatively well-controlled since his last visit. The patient’s parents report intermittent episodes of wheezing and shortness of breath, primarily triggered by physical activity and exposure to cold air. His asthma management includes the use of a short-acting beta-agonist (albuterol), which he uses as needed, with good acute response. He has not required any emergency visits or hospitalizations for asthma since the last appointment. However, there are occasional nighttime coughs disrupting sleep once or twice a week. His parents also mention he had a mild abrasion on his knee sustained during play, which is healing well.

    The patient has a history of multiple contusions from minor injuries typical of an active child, and occasional conjunctivitis, which has resolved. The family has focused on maintaining a smoke-free environment and promoting regular physical activity.
