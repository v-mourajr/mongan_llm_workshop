### Assessment
1. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder:**
    - **Assessment:** The patient’s symptoms of anxiety and depression seem to be well-managed with her current medication regimen, though ongoing monitoring is needed.
    - **Diagnostic Tests:** Follow-up with a mental health specialist may be considered if symptoms persist or worsen.
    - **Treatment Plan:** Continue Desipramine Hydrochloride 25mg daily. Discuss coping strategies and consider referral to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

2. **Irregular Menstrual Cycle:**
    - **Assessment:** The irregularity in the menstrual cycle warrants further investigation to rule out potential underlying causes such as hormonal imbalances or gynecological conditions.
    - **Diagnostic Tests:** Pelvic ultrasound and possible endocrinology consult.
    - **Treatment Plan:** Continue current contraceptive method (Lo/Ovral) and monitor menstrual cycle. Follow up after diagnostic tests.

3. **Headache and Joint Pain:**
    - **Assessment:** Chronic tension headaches and joint pain, particularly in the hands, suggest the need for further evaluation.
    - **Diagnostic Tests:** Routine blood work including complete blood count (CBC), metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers such as ESR.
    - **Treatment Plan:** Continue Naproxen as needed for pain management. Educate the patient on ergonomic practices to minimize joint strain. Consider referral to a rheumatologist if pain persists.

### Plan
- **Follow-Up:** The patient is instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if any new symptoms arise. A follow-up visit is scheduled in 4 weeks to discuss the results of pelvic ultrasound and blood tests, and to reassess the management plan based on those results.
- **Patient Education:** The patient was provided with educational materials in Spanish regarding managing anxiety, depression, and joint pain. The patient confirmed her understanding of the plan and instructions with the help of a medical interpreter.
