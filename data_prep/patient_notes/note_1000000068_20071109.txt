**Visit Information:**
- Patient Number: 1000000068

**Subjective:**
This is a 28-year-old Black female who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately six years. She presents today for a follow-up appointment due to persistent knee issues and other general health concerns. The patient's primary complaint is ongoing left knee pain coupled with recurrent dislocations, despite undergoing a patellar stabilization procedure and participating in physical therapy. She describes the knee swelling and pain as being particularly exacerbated by prolonged walking or wearing high-heeled shoes and partially alleviated by NSAIDs and rest. Moreover, she reports episodic joint pain in the lower extremities, which increases with exertion and restricts her physical activities significantly.

Her past medical history includes the removal of a fixation device from her tibia, recurrent dislocation of the lower leg joint, osteochondritis dissecans, and congenital lower limb anomalies. She also has a known history of allergic rhinitis and has been treated for benign skin neoplasms. Her obstetric history includes previously managed threatened labor.

Socially, she does not smoke or use illicit drugs, and she consumes alcohol only socially. She works a sedentary job that minimizes heavy activity during office hours but regularly engages in light physical activity at home to help manage her knee symptoms. She is allergic to penicillin, which causes a rash and hives.

Currently, she is on the following medications: Accutane for acne, which has caused mild skin dryness; Claritin, which effectively controls her allergic rhinitis symptoms; Cefazolin Sodium for post-surgical infection management; Clindamycin as an additional antibiotic; Desquam-X gel for acne treatment, with a noted positive response; and Tretinoin cream, which has contributed significantly to the improvement of her skin condition.

**Objective:**
- **Vital Signs:**
  - Blood Pressure: 118/76 mmHg
  - Heart Rate: 72 bpm
  - Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths/min
  - Temperature: 98.6Â°F
  - Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

- **General Appearance:**
The patient appeared alert and oriented, without signs of acute distress, although she presented with a mild, noticeable limp on the left side when walking.

- **Cardiovascular:**
Cardiac examination was unremarkable with a regular rate and rhythm. There were no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, and peripheral pulses were strong and symmetric in all extremities.

- **Respiratory:**
Lung auscultation revealed clear breath sounds and no evidence of wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

- **Abdomen:**
The abdomen was non-distended and soft, with normal bowel sounds. There was no tenderness, masses, or organomegaly detected.

- **Musculoskeletal:**
Examination of the left knee revealed mild swelling and tenderness around the patella and the joint line. Instability was confirmed through positive varus and valgus stress tests. The range of motion was reduced, and maneuvers elicited pain. No significant joint laxity was noted in other extremities.

- **Neurological:**
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact. Strength was 5/5 in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally. The patient had normal sensation to light touch and proprioception, and deep tendon reflexes were 2+ and symmetric.

- **Skin:**
A well-healed surgical scar was noted on the left knee with no signs of infection. The skin was otherwise clear, with no rashes, lesions, or abnormal neoplasms.

Recent laboratory findings indicated the presence of amorphous crystals and bacteria in the urine, suggesting possible renal or urinary abnormalities. Hematologic parameters, including hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet counts, were within normal ranges.

**Assessment:**
1. **Recurrent Dislocation of the Left Knee:** The chronic instability is likely a consequence of her congenital limb anomalies and previous injuries, necessitating ongoing management.
2. **Chronic Joint Pain:** Likely due to osteochondritis dissecans and post-operative changes in the left knee.
3. **Post-Operative Follow-Up:** Continuing to monitor for complications related to the recent patellar stabilization surgery.

**Plan:**
1. **Recurrent Dislocation:**
   - Maintain an intensive physical therapy regimen focused on knee stabilization.
   - Refer the patient to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation, including potential advanced imaging or consideration of surgical options.

2. **Chronic Joint Pain:**
   - Continue NSAIDs for pain relief, with the addition of acetaminophen as needed.
   - Adjust physical therapy exercises to better balance pain management with mobility improvement.
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to reassess her progress and pain management.

3. **Post-Surgical Care:**
   - Continue treating with Cefazolin and monitor for signs of infection at the surgical site.
   - Advise the patient to monitor for increased redness, swelling, or pain and contact the clinic if any of these symptoms occur.

**Follow-Up:**
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate the need for further evaluation. The patient was educated on the treatment plan and acknowledged the instructions. A follow-up appointment will be arranged in 6 weeks to monitor progress and manage any ongoing issues.
