Subjective:
    - Chief Complaints & History of Present Illness:
        This is a 13-year-old Hispanic male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 6 months. He is a German speaker who presents today for a follow-up on his asthma management, specifically to address an exacerbation that has worsened over the past week.
    - Past Medical & Surgical History:
        The patient has a notable history of asthma, both with and without status asthmaticus, attention deficit disorder of childhood (both with and without hyperactivity), developmental dyslexia, other speech disturbances, and unspecified chronic disease of tonsils and adenoids. He has previously undergone circumcision due to redundant prepuce and phimosis, and experienced otitis media.
    - Medications & Supplements:
        The patient is currently on inhaled corticosteroids and a short-acting beta agonist for the management of asthma. He also takes methylphenidate for attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity.
    - Social History:
        The patient resides with his parents who are supportive of his treatment plans and education. He is currently attending middle school where his academic performance is affected by his attention deficit disorder and dyslexia.
    - Allergies:
        No known drug allergies.
    - Symptom Details:
        Over the past week, the patient has experienced increased wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing, particularly at night. He reports chest tightness but denies fever or chills. The symptoms are aggravated by physical activity and alleviated somewhat with his rescue inhaler. Additionally, his parents note increased hyperactivity and difficulties with schoolwork.
    - Additional Narrative:
        The patient has been using non-pharmacological interventions such as avoiding known asthma triggers and using his inhaler as prescribed. However, he reports not much relief from these measures. There have been no new side effects from his medications, but his parents report an increase in behavioral problems linked to his ADHD.
