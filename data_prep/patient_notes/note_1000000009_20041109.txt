**Subjective:**
This is a 16-year-old Hispanic female who has been receiving care at our clinic for several years. She speaks English and presents today for a follow-up appointment. The patient reports experiencing generalized abdominal pain for the past three days. She describes the pain as diffuse and aching, with intermittent sharp episodes. She has experienced nausea and a decreased appetite but denies vomiting or changes in bowel habits. Eating or drinking exacerbates the pain, while resting provides some alleviation. No associated fever is noted; she denies recent illnesses or significant changes in her diet or daily activities.

The patient's past medical history is notable for recurrent upper respiratory infections, acute pharyngitis, croup, and unspecified otitis media. She has also been diagnosed with essential hypertension and had a foreign body removed from her larynx in the past. Her medication regimen includes a daily antihypertensive medication, which she has been compliant with and finds effective. For her current abdominal discomfort, her parents have given her over-the-counter acetaminophen with limited success.

Socially, the patient lives with her parents and is a middle school student. There is no exposure to tobacco smoke at home. She actively participates in school activities and physical education. There are no known drug allergies. Her abdominal pain began three days ago and has been persistent, with no vomiting but notable nausea. The pain is worse after consuming food or fluids. Non-pharmacological interventions attempted include dietary adjustments and warm compresses, with minimal relief.
