This is a 37-year-old Hispanic female who has been receiving care at our clinic regularly. She primarily speaks German and works as a full-time translator. The patient presented today for a follow-up visit reporting multiple ongoing health concerns and symptoms.

Subjective:
Chief Complaints & History of Present Illness:
The patient is experiencing an increase in frequency and severity of her headaches, which she describes as throbbing pain localized to the frontal area, occurring nearly daily. She also reports significant discomfort due to dysmenorrhea, describing the menstrual cramps as more severe than usual. Additionally, she continues to experience symptoms of her congenital aortic valve insufficiency, including occasional episodes of dizziness and palpitations. She has perennial allergic rhinitis, which has worsened recently, causing nasal congestion and frequent sneezing.

Past Medical & Surgical History:
The patient's past medical history is significant for congenital aortic valve insufficiency, chronic skin ulcers, and leiomyoma of the uterus. She has no history of surgical interventions.

Medications & Supplements:
Currently, she is taking Acyclovir suspension for a past viral infection, Demulen 1/35 as an oral contraceptive, and Terfenadine for allergic rhinitis. Although the medications have been generally well tolerated, she has noted occasional dizziness, which may be related to her cardiac condition.

Social History:
She lives alone and recently started practicing yoga to manage stress. There is no history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.

Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

Symptom Details:
Her headaches are described as throbbing, localized to the frontal area, and occurring almost daily. Dysmenorrhea presents as severe cramping starting a day before menstruation, lasting through the first two days of bleeding. Episodes of dizziness occur both at rest and with exertion, and palpitations do not follow a specific pattern. Allergic rhinitis is present year-round but worsens with exposure to environmental allergens such as dust and pollen.

Additional Narrative:
The patient has employed various non-pharmacological interventions such as a humidifier for her rhinitis and hot compresses for menstrual cramps, which have provided only limited relief. She is exploring alternative treatments, including switching contraceptive methods due to concerns about her current medication's potential side effects.

Objective:
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 128/80 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 74 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 36.8Â°C
- Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

General Appearance:
The patient appears well-kempt, in no acute distress, and maintains good eye contact throughout the examination.

Cardiovascular:
A cardiovascular examination revealed a III/VI diastolic murmur at the right sternal border, consistent with aortic regurgitation. Peripheral pulses are intact, and there is no evidence of peripheral edema.

Respiratory:
Lung fields are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no audible wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.

Abdomen:
The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no organomegaly. Bowel sounds are present and normal.

Musculoskeletal:
No joint swelling or deformities were noted. The patient exhibited a full range of motion in all limbs.

Neurological:
Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. Motor and sensory functions are normal, and reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Romberg's test was negative.

Skin:
A chronic ulcer, approximately 1 cm in diameter, was noted on the left lower extremity. The wound base is clean, and there are no signs of infection. There are areas of hyperpigmentation observed on the lower legs.

Assessment:
Diagnosis or Clinical Impression:
1. Congenital aortic valve insufficiency with symptoms of dizziness and palpitations.
2. Leiomyoma of the uterus presenting with dysmenorrhea.
3. Chronic skin ulcer requiring ongoing management.
4. Allergic rhinitis with exacerbated symptoms.
5. Recurrent headaches with characteristics suggestive of tension-type.

Plan:
1. Congenital aortic valve insufficiency: Continue monitoring symptoms with regular follow-up. An ECG and echocardiography are recommended to evaluate current cardiac function. Referral to cardiology is advised.
2. Leiomyoma of the uterus: Discuss with gynecologist the severity of symptoms and management options, including hormonal therapy or other interventions.
3. Chronic ulcer: Continue current wound care regimen. Consider referring to a specialist in wound care if no improvement is noted at the next follow-up.
4. Allergic rhinitis: Continue Terfenadine. Suggest adding a nasal corticosteroid spray and implementing allergen avoidance strategies.
5. Headaches: Recommend maintaining a headache diary and trial of NSAIDs for symptomatic relief. Consider referral to neurology if headaches persist or worsen.

Patient Education & Understanding of the Plan:
The patient was instructed to monitor her symptoms carefully, adhere to medication regimens, and attend all follow-up appointments. She was informed about red flags, including worsening chest pain or significant changes in dizziness, which would require immediate medical attention.

Follow-Up:
The patient was advised to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed. A follow-up appointment was scheduled in one month to reassess all conditions and review diagnostic test results. This structured follow-up aims to ensure comprehensive management of the patient's complex medical conditions and improve her overall health outcomes.
