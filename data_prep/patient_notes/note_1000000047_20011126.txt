This is a 31-year-old Black male who has been receiving care at our clinic for issues related to allergic rhinitis, notably due to various allergens including pollen, persisting for a considerable amount of time and the presence of abnormal liver function test results. He speaks English and presented today, 11/26/2001, for a follow-up regarding his ongoing allergies and concerning symptoms related to liver function. His history includes allergic rhinitis and several instances of open wounds, both uncomplicated and complicated. His regular medications include Hismanal for his allergic symptoms, and Metronidazole which was earlier prescribed possibly for an unrelated infection. He does not report any new allergies to medications or food.

The patient reports experiencing ongoing nasal congestion, sneezing, and itchy eyes, which have worsened in the past week and are not well controlled with Hismanal. He also mentions general malaise and fatigue which he fears could be associated with his liver condition. He denies any recent changes in weight, appetite, or jaundice. Additionally, he reports intermittent abdominal pain on the right side but denies nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits.

The patient has a significant history of allergic rhinitis due to various allergens, and additional isolated occurrences of chronic bronchitis in the past. He has had an open wound on his hand and fingers previously but they have healed without complications. He was administered a respiratory medication via nebulizer once for an episode unrelated to his current exclusion criteria. There is no psychiatric history noted in this visit. Socially, he is a non-smoker, does not consume alcohol, and denies illicit drug use. He is currently employed in a clerical position with no known occupational hazards.

On physical examination, the patient’s vital signs are as follows: Blood Pressure: 125/80 mmHg, Heart Rate: 76 bpm, Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute, Temperature: 98.6°F, and Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.

He appears well-nourished and in no acute distress. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular heart rate and rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Respiratory effort is normal with no wheezing or rales detected on auscultation. His abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant with no palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal and neurological examinations are unremarkable. Skin examination reveals normal turgor with no rashes or lesions observed.

Laboratory tests reveal several pertinent findings: elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and abnormalities in bilirubin levels (both direct and total) indicating a chronic liver condition that requires further investigation. His cholesterol tests indicate levels that might necessitate dietary consultations, while his other metabolic panels including glucose and protein counts are within normal ranges.

**Assessment:**
1. Chronic allergic rhinitis, exacerbated by exposure to multiple allergens.
2. Abnormal liver function tests indicating potential chronic liver disease.
3. Intermittent abdominal pain not associated with acute bowel or gastrointestinal pathology.

**Plan:**
1. For allergic rhinitis: Continue Hismanal and consider adding a nasal steroid spray such as Fluticasone to better manage symptoms. Recommend follow-up with an allergist for potential allergen-specific immunotherapy.
2. For liver function abnormalities: Order repeat liver function tests including a complete liver panel, and recommend abdominal ultrasound to rule out liver pathology. Referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management of potentially chronic liver disease is advisable.
3. For abdominal pain: Monitor symptoms and recommend dietary modifications to avoid potential food triggers. 

The patient was educated about the importance of adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications to manage his allergic symptoms and potential liver condition. He was advised to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week or if laboratory results indicate further evaluation is needed. 

A follow-up appointment is scheduled for two weeks to review new lab results and re-evaluate symptoms.
