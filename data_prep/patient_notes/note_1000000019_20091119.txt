This is a 12-year-old Indian male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 7 years. He speaks German and presented today, on November 19, 2009, for a follow-up visit concerning asthma management and recent respiratory symptoms.

**Subjective:**
The patient’s father reports an increase in his son’s coughing and difficulty breathing, primarily at night. These symptoms have persisted for the past week, only partially relieved by his albuterol inhaler. Additionally, the patient has a runny nose and mild sore throat, likely due to a recent cold. His asthma has been managed with albuterol as needed, yet the current exacerbation raises concerns about overall control.

His medical history is significant for asthma, specifically extrinsic asthma with and without acute exacerbations, recurrent episodes of acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis due to infection in childhood, and one episode of acute sinusitis. He also experienced acute upper respiratory infections earlier this year. The patient's history includes a forceps delivery and meconium aspiration syndrome at birth. Constipation is managed through dietary adjustments. Current medications include albuterol as needed and a recent course of prednisolone for acute exacerbations.

No medication allergies are reported. His social history indicates he lives in a supportive household free of environmental tobacco smoke and currently attends school with regular physical activity.

**Objective:**
- **Vital Signs:**
    - Blood Pressure: 102/68 mmHg
    - Heart Rate: 108 bpm
    - Respiratory Rate: 26 breaths per minute
    - Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
    - Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air

- **General Appearance:**
    The patient appears slightly distressed due to coughing fits but remains alert and cooperative.

- **Cardiovascular:**
    Regular rate and rhythm with no audible murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

- **Respiratory:**
    Auscultation reveals bilateral expiratory wheezes with prolonged expiration. Mild intercostal retractions are present, with no rales or rhonchi noted.

- **Abdomen:**
    Soft, non-tender, non-distended, with normal active bowel sounds.

- **Musculoskeletal:**
    Normal muscle tone and range of motion. No swelling or tenderness in the joints or extremities.

- **Neurological:**
    Alert, oriented, and appropriate for age. Cranial nerves II-XII intact.

- **Skin:**
    No rashes, lesions, or abnormalities noted.

**Assessment:**
- **Asthma exacerbation:**
    The patient is experiencing an exacerbation likely triggered by a concurrent acute upper respiratory infection. Despite using his albuterol inhaler, he continues to have increased coughing and nocturnal symptoms, indicating suboptimal asthma control.

- **Acute respiratory infection:**
    Likely viral and contributing to the current asthma exacerbation. The patient presents with symptoms consistent with a common cold and exacerbation of asthma without indication of bacterial infection.

- **Constipation:**
    The patient’s chronic constipation is currently managed well with dietary modifications.

**Plan:**
- **Asthma exacerbation:**
    Initiate a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone) to manage the acute exacerbation. Increase the frequency of albuterol use as necessary. If symptoms persist, consider initiating a long-term controller medication such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess the patient's condition.

- **Acute respiratory infection:**
    Provide supportive care including rest, increased fluid intake, and over-the-counter decongestants if needed. Advise continuous monitoring of symptoms at home.

- **Constipation:**
    Continue emphasizing the intake of dietary fiber and adequate hydration. No additional diagnostic tests are required at this time.

The patient’s father is advised to monitor his son closely for signs of worsening respiratory distress, such as increased use of accessory muscles, cyanosis, or a drop in oxygen saturation. He is instructed to contact the clinic immediately if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a few days. A follow-up is scheduled for one week to monitor the response to the treatment. Both the patient and his father were educated on the importance of medication adherence, the correct use of inhalers, recognizing signs of an asthma attack, and supportive care measures for respiratory infections. The father demonstrated understanding of the treatment plan and follow-up instructions.
