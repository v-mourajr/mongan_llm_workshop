### Visit Information:
- **Patient Num:** 1000000105
- **Visit Date:** 10/26/1998

### Subjective:
This is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who has been under care for conditions including asthma, chronic obstructive asthma, bipolar disorder, and other chronic ailments. He speaks German and has been visiting our clinic for a variety of health issues over the course of approximately 18 months. Today, he presents for a follow-up visit primarily to manage his asthma but also has additional concerns related to his ongoing medical conditions.

He reports experiencing increased wheezing and shortness of breath over the past two weeks, particularly at night. He also notes a persistent cough that produces clear sputum. His asthma symptoms are exacerbated by physical exertion and exposure to cold air. He has been using his prescribed inhalers regularly but feels they have been less effective recently. For his bipolar disorder, he has been stable on his medication regimen without significant mood episodes. He also mentions intermittent chest discomfort and reflux symptoms, managed partially by dietary changes. His lower back pain, associated with intervertebral disc displacement and spinal stenosis, remains managed by physical therapy and occasional use of analgesics.

Medications include a long-acting beta agonist inhaler, a corticosteroid inhaler, and an as-needed short-acting bronchodilator. He takes medications for his bipolar disorder, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gout.

The patient denies any recent hospitalizations or emergency department visits. He is a non-smoker, lives a sedentary lifestyle, and his diet lacks severe restrictions.

### Assessment:
The patient has a history of asthma, unspecified and chronic obstructive types, exacerbated by environmental triggers and physical activity. Additionally, he has other chronic conditions including bipolar disorder, intervertebral disc displacement, esophageal reflux, gout, lumbar spinal stenosis, and essential hypertension.

### Plan:
- **Asthma:**
   - Continue current inhaler regimen, increase the dose of corticosteroid inhaler temporarily for exacerbation.
   - Add a leukotriene receptor antagonist to the medication regimen.
   - Follow-up with pulmonary function tests to assess the status and management efficacy.
   - Patient education on avoiding known triggers and proper inhaler technique.
- **Bipolar Disorder:**
   - Maintain current medication regimen.
   - Schedule a follow-up with psychiatry for medication review and mental health evaluation.
- **Chronic Back Pain:**

   - Follow up in 3 months or sooner if symptoms persist or worsen.
- **Hypertension and Hypercholesterolemia:**
   - Maintain current antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy.
   - Schedule a follow-up for blood pressure monitoring and lipid check in 3 months.
