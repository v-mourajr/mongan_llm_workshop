This is a 22-year-old Indian female who has attended our clinic for approximately six years. She speaks German and has an extensive history of asthma with frequent exacerbations. The patient has come today for a follow-up visit to discuss ongoing concerns related to her asthma and review recent lab results. She reports a notable increase in frequency and severity of asthma symptoms, including a persistent cough, shortness of breath on exertion, and occasional chest tightness, particularly during cold weather.

The patient has a medical history that includes bronchitis, chronic pharyngitis, cardiomegaly, scoliosis, and anemia. She is currently taking inhaled corticosteroids and a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) for her asthma management. She adheres to her medication regimen and uses her inhaler regularly during asthma attacks. She describes her asthma as manageable with her current treatment but is concerned about the recent increase in symptoms.

- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths/min
- Temperature: 98.4°F (36.9°C)
- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air

**General Appearance:**
The patient appears well-nourished and is in no apparent distress. She is alert and cooperative during the examination.

**Cardiovascular:**
The cardiovascular exam reveals normal heart sounds with a regular rate and rhythm. There are no murmurs, gallops, or rubs auscultated.

**Skin:**
The skin is warm and dry without any rashes or lesions.

**Assessment:**

**Diagnosis or Clinical Impression:**
The patient has asthma with an increased frequency of exacerbations, predominantly in response to allergens and physical activity. There is a concurrent history of recurring bronchitis, chronic pharyngitis, scoliosis, and cardiomegaly that may impact her respiratory function.

**Issue/Problem/Request 1:**
**Assessment:**
- Increased frequency of asthma exacerbations.
- Differential Diagnosis: Allergic triggers, changes in weather, possible respiratory infections.

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- Lung function tests (Spirometry) to evaluate the extent of airway obstruction.
- Allergy testing to identify specific environmental or occupational triggers.

**Treatment Plan:**
- Continue the current regimen of inhaled corticosteroids and SABA as needed.
- Consider adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist to reduce the frequency of exacerbations if the current treatment proves insufficient.
- Educate the patient on the importance of avoiding known triggers and adhering strictly to her asthma action plan.
- Referral to a pulmonologist for comprehensive management and possible modification of the treatment plan.

**Follow-Up:**

**Instructions for emergent follow-up care or monitoring:**
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen, do not improve within a week, or if new symptoms, such as fever or a persistent cough, develop.

**Follow-Up for persistent, changing, or worsening symptoms:**
Schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to review spirometry results and evaluate the efficacy of the current asthma management plan.

**Patient Education & Understanding of the Plan:**
The patient was advised on the importance of continued adherence to asthma medications and trigger avoidance. The education included recognizing early signs of asthma exacerbation and using rescue inhalers appropriately. The patient confirmed understanding and expressed confidence in the care plan.
