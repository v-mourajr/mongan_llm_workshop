**Visit Information:**
- Patient Num: 1000000071
- Visit Date: 02/11/2004

This is an 82-year-old Black female who has been receiving care at our clinic for several years. She speaks primarily German. The patient is visiting today for follow-up and to address several health concerns she has been experiencing recently.

**Subjective:**
The patient reports an increase in urinary frequency and dysuria over the past week, which has significantly interfered with her daily activities and quality of life. She also mentions intermittent episodes of nausea and vomiting that she attributes to her current antibiotic medication, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, prescribed for a recurrent urinary tract infection. Over the past three months, she has been treated for two urinary tract infections and has noted a likely adverse reaction to a previous antibiotic.

Her past medical history is notable for a benign neoplasm of the colon, which was diagnosed during a routine colonoscopy last year. She does not report any recent gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits. She is currently taking a multivitamin, omeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and the antibiotic for her urinary symptoms. She has been compliant with her medications but finds the gastrointestinal discomfort from the antibiotic particularly troublesome.

From a social standpoint, the patient lives alone but maintains an active lifestyle, including daily walks with her dog. She retired from teaching 11 years ago and denies any history of smoking or alcohol use. She has not reported any allergies.

Her urinary symptoms consist of a sharp, burning sensation during urination and an increased urgency that disrupts her routine. The nausea and vomiting typically occur after she takes her morning medications and with meal times. She has not found any alleviating factors for these symptoms. She rates her dysuria as a 6 out of 10 and her nausea and vomiting as a 4 out of 10 in severity.

**Objective:**
Upon physical examination, the patient presents in no acute distress and is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her vital signs are as follows:
- Blood Pressure: 140/85 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 82 beats per minute
- Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.6Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

Her general appearance is consistent with her age, and she has no signs of acute distress. The cardiovascular examination reveals regular heart sounds with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Peripheral pulses are 2+ bilaterally, and there is no edema.

On respiratory examination, her breath sounds are clear bilaterally with no wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. The abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender, and non-distended abdomen with normal bowel sounds and no palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal examination shows a full range of motion in all extremities with no joint swelling or deformity.

Neurological examination reveals intact cranial nerves II-XII, with normal strength and sensation in all extremities. Her reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. The skin examination shows warm, dry skin with no rashes, lesions, or significant bruising.

Recent lab results include normal values for albumin, amylase, AST, basophils, bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, carbon dioxide, chloride, creatinine, direct bilirubin, eosinophils, globulin, glucose, hematocrit, hemoglobin, various blood counts, and kidney function parameters. Notably, her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels suggest possible renal involvement.

**Assessment:**
1. **Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection:**
   - Likely diagnosis: Recurrent UTI
   - Differential diagnosis: Interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder
   - Diagnostic Tests: Urinalysis and urine culture
   - Treatment Plan: Continue trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 7 days. Encourage the patient to increase fluid intake. Closely monitor for symptom resolution or progression.

2. **Dyspepsia secondary to antibiotic use:**
   - Likely diagnosis: Medication-induced dyspepsia
   - Differential diagnosis: GERD exacerbation, peptic ulcer disease
   - Diagnostic Tests: Complete blood count, hepatic function panel
   - Treatment Plan: Continue omeprazole. Consider supplementation with antacids as needed.

3. **Nausea and Vomiting:**
   - Likely diagnosis: Medication-induced nausea
   - Differential diagnosis: Gastroenteritis, gastritis
   - Diagnostic Tests: Electrolyte panel
   - Treatment Plan: Prescribe an antiemetic, such as ondansetron, as needed. Advise on maintaining proper hydration and consuming small, frequent meals.

**Follow-Up:**
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed. Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to reassess urinary symptoms and review laboratory results. Provide education on the importance of completing the antibiotic course and managing side effects with over-the-counter options if needed. The patient verbalizes an understanding of the treatment plan and agrees to follow the outlined instructions.
