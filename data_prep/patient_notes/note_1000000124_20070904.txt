She has experienced joint pain frequently and has a history of hypertrophy of the breast, for which she underwent bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Additionally, she has suffered from tears of the medial cartilage of the knee, episodes of edema, and previous fever instances.

- **Medications & Supplements:**
Currently, the patient is on Albuterol for managing acute asthma symptoms, Cefazolin Sodium for infection during exacerbations, Morphine Sulfate for severe pain related to joints, and Precare Conceive Prenatal Multivitamins. She has also had episodes requiring Droperidol for nausea management.

The patient describes the symptoms as more intense and frequent this past week, predominantly worsening at night. Her productive cough, although not bloody, and chest tightness aggravate with exertion and exposure to cold air.

  - Electrolytes panel with special attention to potassium levels, considering her history of hypokalemia.

- **Treatment Plan:**
  - Continue the current use of Albuterol but increase the frequency of usage.
  - Introduce an inhaled corticosteroid such as Budesonide for better asthma control.

  - Use humidified oxygen if oxygen saturation drops below 92%.

- **Referrals:**
  - Referral to an allergist for potential allergen-specific immunotherapy.
  - Referral to a respiratory therapist for asthma education and review of the asthma action plan.
