- Visit Date: 03/16/1998

**Subjective:**
This is a 52-year-old Indian female who has been receiving care at our clinic for various conditions over the past month. She speaks English fluently. She presents today for a follow-up appointment, primarily to address concerns related to her asthma and to manage ongoing gynecological issues.

The patient reports that her asthma symptoms, which include intermittent wheezing and shortness of breath, have largely been under control with her inhaler. However, she mentions experiencing increased coughing episodes at night, which disrupt her sleep. She denies any recent upper respiratory infections.

In terms of her gynecological history, she has had a significant past medical history of cervicitis and endocervicitis, endometriosis of the uterus, and several leiomyomas. She has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy and other operative procedures to manage these conditions. She also deals with hypopotassemia and other disorders of menstruation that have caused abnormal bleeding.

She is currently taking albuterol as a rescue inhaler for her asthma and has been diligent with her usage. Additionally, she is on a potassium supplement to manage her hypokalemia. She denies using any herbal supplements.

Her social history reveals that she is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She is married and has two adult children. She manages a sedentary job and leads a relatively inactive lifestyle due to her health issues.

The patient experiences disrupted sleep due to nocturnal asthma symptoms and reports mild abdominal discomfort related to her gynecological conditions. She has tried using a humidifier at night which she finds somewhat helpful for her asthma symptoms. She denies any recent fevers or significant weight changes.
