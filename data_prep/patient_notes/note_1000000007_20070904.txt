**Subjective:**
This is a 27-year-old Asian male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately nine years. He primarily speaks Spanish and presents today for a routine follow-up evaluation. The patient reports that his asthma symptoms have been relatively well managed with his albuterol inhaler, which he uses as needed. However, he has experienced occasional episodes of shortness of breath and wheezing, particularly during physical exertion, which have been effectively relieved by his inhaler. He has also noticed an increase in his seasonal allergy symptoms, which he suspects may be contributing to his respiratory difficulties.

His past medical history is significant for asthma, including both unspecified and extrinsic types. Additionally, he has a history of cardiac dysrhythmias, specifically paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, for which he underwent catheter ablation about three years ago. He is currently on an albuterol inhaler as needed and receives allergy immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis. 

The patient denies the use of herbal supplements and has not had any recent surgeries besides the prior cardiac procedures. Socially, he is a college student living with roommates and participates in recreational sports. He reports no smoking, alcohol consumption, or recreational drug use. He has no known drug allergies.

**Objective:**
- **Vital Signs:**
  - Blood Pressure: 118/76 mmHg
  - Heart Rate: 72 bpm
  - Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
  - Temperature: 98.6Â°F
  - Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

- **General Appearance:**
  The patient appears well-nourished, in no apparent distress, and is alert and oriented to time, place, and person.

- **Cardiovascular:**
  Regular heart rate and rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. No jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, or signs of heart failure noted.

- **Respiratory:**
  Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi were detected. No use of accessory muscles or nasal flaring was observed. Good air movement was noted on auscultation.

- **Abdomen:**
  The abdomen is soft and non-tender without distension. Normal bowel sounds were heard.

- **Musculoskeletal:**
  The patient has a full range of motion in all extremities without joint deformities, tenderness, or swelling. No signs of recurrent shoulder dislocation were noted.

- **Neurological:**
  Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. There are no focal neurological deficits. The patient is alert and oriented.

- **Skin:**
  The skin is intact with good turgor. No rashes or lesions were observed.

**Assessment:**
- **Asthma:** The patient's asthma appears to be under good control with his as-needed albuterol inhaler, though he reports occasional exacerbations likely triggered by seasonal allergies.
- **Cardiac Dysrhythmia:** The patient has a history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and is currently asymptomatic post-catheter ablation.
- **Allergic Rhinitis:** There is an increase in symptoms noted, which likely contributes to the recent asthma exacerbations.

**Plan:**
1. **Asthma:**
   - Continue the use of the albuterol inhaler as needed.
   - Consider initiating an inhaled corticosteroid if the patient experiences persistent or worsening symptoms.
   - Review and reinforce the patient's asthma action plan and proper inhaler technique.
   - No immediate additional diagnostic tests or referrals are necessary at this time.

2. **Allergic Rhinitis:**
   - Continue with allergy immunotherapy.
   - Recommend the use of over-the-counter antihistamines as needed.
   - Advise the patient on environmental controls to reduce allergen exposure.
   - Schedule a follow-up in one month to reassess the condition.

3. **Cardiac Management:**
   - Continue monitoring for any recurrence of symptoms related to dysrhythmias.
   - No new immediate interventions or diagnostic tests are needed as the patient remains asymptomatic.

**Follow-Up:**
- The patient is instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen, do not improve within a week, or if any breathing difficulties arise.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to reassess the asthma and allergic rhinitis.
- The patient was educated on the importance of medication adherence, environmental control measures for allergies, and recognizing early signs of asthma exacerbation. The patient demonstrated an understanding of and agreed to the management plan.
