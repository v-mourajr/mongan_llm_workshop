This is a 65-year-old White female who speaks English and has been receiving care at our clinic since April 17th, 1997. She presents today for a routine follow-up appointment primarily regarding her well-established diagnosis of asthma. Additionally, she has a history of anxiety, abdominal pain, hypothyroidism, osteoarthrosis in the pelvic region and thigh, and various injuries, including fractures and lower leg joint effusion, as well as previous toxic gas exposure. 

**Subjective:**
The patient reports experiencing intermittent wheezing and shortness of breath, particularly noticeable during her typical daily activities. Despite compliance with her current asthma medications, these symptoms have persisted over the past few months. She also mentions persistent anxiety episodes, which often correlate with her respiratory symptoms. Although she occasionally experiences abdominal discomfort linked to her history of cholecystitis, she reports no recent acute flare-ups.

Her current medication regimen includes inhaled corticosteroids (Albuterol Sulfate) for asthma management, an anxiolytic (Clozaril) for anxiety, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for joint pain. She has not experienced any new medication side effects or recent illnesses, is compliant with her medication regimen, and has not had adverse reactions. Her lifestyle is relatively sedentary due to joint pain.

**Objective:**
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 130/85 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 72 beats per minute
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.6°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air

General Appearance: The patient appears in no acute distress, well-groomed, and cooperative.
Cardiovascular: Heart sounds are regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Respiratory: Bilateral expiratory wheezes, diminished air entry, no rales or rhonchi. The respiratory effort seems increased.
Abdomen: The abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no organomegaly; bowel sounds are present and normal. There is no guarding or elicited pain on palpation.
Musculoskeletal: Tenderness in the lower leg joints and a limited range of motion in the hips due to osteoarthrosis.
Neurological: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. No focal deficits; gross motor function is intact.
Skin: Warm and dry, no rashes or lesions.

**Assessment:**
The patient continues to manage multiple chronic conditions, with primary attention towards her asthma. Based on the clinical presentation and history, the following assessments are pertinent:
1. Persistent asthma with noted symptoms of intermittent wheezing and shortness of breath, with an escalation of symptoms recently.
2. Anxiety, potentially exacerbating respiratory discomfort and contributing to the fluctuation of symptomatic asthma.
3. Chronic abdominal pain secondary to a history of cholecystitis, with controlled but recurrent discomfort.
4. Osteoarthrosis of the pelvic region and thigh, contributing to decreased mobility and pain.
5. Hypothyroidism, well-managed with current levothyroxine therapy.

**Plan:**
1. Asthma:
   - Maintain current inhaled corticosteroids and consider increasing the dosage.
   - Evaluate the addition of a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) if symptoms persist.
   - Recommend pulmonary function testing to assess current respiratory status.
   - Educate the patient on peak flow monitoring at home and implement an asthma action plan.

2. Anxiety:
   - Continue the current anxiolytic medication.
   - Refer for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to improve anxiety management techniques.
   - Assess potential interactions between asthma and anxiety treatments.

3. Chronic Abdominal Pain:
   - Recommend a follow-up abdominal ultrasound to rule out any acute pathology.
   - Continue dietary adjustments and NSAIDs for symptom control.

4. Osteoarthrosis:
   - Continue NSAIDs for joint pain.
   - Referral to physical therapy for a structured exercise regime to improve mobility and reduce pain.
   - Discuss options for joint injections if pain persists.

5. Hypothyroidism:
   - Continue current levothyroxine therapy.
   - Schedule regular thyroid function tests to ensure euthyroid status.

Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed. Patient education was provided regarding the management of asthma, recognizing symptoms that require urgent care, and avoiding known triggers. The patient verbalized understanding and is willing to comply with the recommended plan. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in three months, or sooner if necessary based on the patient’s progress.
