This is an 8-year-old Hispanic male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately one year. He speaks English and presents today for a follow-up visit. His primary diagnosis over this period has been asthma, with various subtypes including unspecified asthma without mention of status asthmaticus, extrinsic asthma with status asthmaticus, and extrinsic asthma without mention of status asthmaticus noted in his record. He also has a history of recurrent pneumonia and undiagnosed cardiac murmurs.

Subjective:

The patient's mother reports that he has been experiencing increased frequency and severity of asthma attacks over the past month. These episodes often occur at night and are sometimes triggered by physical activity and allergens such as dust and pollen. His current medication regimen includes albuterol for acute episodes and a daily inhaled corticosteroid. The patient’s asthma has previously required emergency department visits, particularly during episodes of status asthmaticus. The medications appear partially effective, but nocturnal symptoms and exercise-induced wheezing have limited his physical activities recently. There are no known allergies.

The patient has no history of surgeries. His social history is typical for his age; he lives with his parents in a smoke-free household and attends elementary school, although he has missed several days due to respiratory symptoms. 

Objective:

Vital Signs:
    - Blood Pressure: 110/70 mmHg
    - Heart Rate: 95 bpm
    - Respiratory Rate: 25 breaths per minute
    - Temperature: 98.6°F
    - Oxygen Saturation: 94% on room air

General Appearance:
The patient appears in no acute distress but is using accessory muscles to breathe. He is alert and cooperative.

Cardiovascular:
Auscultation reveals a soft, grade II/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Heart sounds S1 and S2 are otherwise normal. No gallops or rubs are noted.

Respiratory:
Inspection shows mild intercostal retractions. Auscultation reveals expiratory wheezing throughout the lung fields, more pronounced in the lower lobes. There are no crackles or rhonchi present.

Abdomen:
The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and without organomegaly. Bowel sounds are normal.

Musculoskeletal:
No joint swelling or deformities; muscle tone and strength are appropriate for age.

Neurological:
The patient is alert and oriented, cranial nerves and reflexes are intact. 

Skin:
There are no rashes, cyanosis, or clubbing noted.

Assessment:

Asthma, unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus, continues to be the primary diagnosis but with evident exacerbations. The patient’s past medical history of extrinsic asthma both with and without statis asthmaticus, as well as recurring pneumonia, complicates the clinical picture. The undiagnosed cardiac murmur seems benign but requires monitoring.

Plan:

1. Asthma management:
    - Continue current use of albuterol (rescue inhaler) and inhaled corticosteroid.
    - Add a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) to the inhaler regimen.
    - Referral to a pediatric pulmonologist for further evaluation of persistent symptoms and optimization of asthma management.
    
2. Pneumonia monitoring:
    - Education on recognizing early signs of infection to prevent recurrence.
    - Consider prophylactic measures during flu season (e.g., influenza vaccine).

3. Cardiac murmur:
    - Schedule a follow-up with pediatric cardiology to evaluate the undiagnosed cardiac murmur further.

Patient Education and Follow-Up:
Instruct the patient’s parents to monitor his symptoms closely and utilize albuterol at the first sign of exacerbation. The patient should avoid known allergens and potential asthma triggers. Emphasize the importance of routine follow-up visits to reassess his condition and adjust medications as necessary. 

Instruct parents to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week. Follow-up appointments should include reassessment of asthma control and review of new medications in one month, or sooner if indicated.

Patient and family verbalize understanding of the treatment plan and agree to comply with the new management regimen.
