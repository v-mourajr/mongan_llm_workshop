Subjective:
This is a 76-year-old Black female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of ongoing urinary symptoms. She has noticed increased urinary frequency and dysuria over the past week. The patient reports a history of benign neoplasm of the colon, which was diagnosed last year during a routine colonoscopy; there have been no recent GI symptoms such as abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits. She experiences intermittent nausea and vomiting, which she attributes to recent medications prescribed for an unspecified infection. Additionally, the patient has a recent history of urinary tract infections, with two documented episodes over the past three months, and a possible adverse reaction to a previous antibiotic treatment.

Her current medications include a multivitamin, omeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a recent prescription of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the urinary infection. She is compliant with her medication regimen but reports significant stomach upset likely attributed to the antibiotic.

The patient lives alone but has supportive family nearby. She retired from her career as a school teacher 11 years ago and stays active by walking her dog daily. She denies smoking and alcohol use. She has no known allergies.

The patient describes her urinary symptoms as a sharp, burning sensation during urination and notes an urgency that disrupts her daily activities. Her nausea and vomiting correlate with meal times and the ingestion of her morning medications; no alleviating factors have been identified. She rates the severity of her dysuria as a 6 out of 10 and her overall discomfort with nausea and vomiting as a 4 out of 10.
