**Subjective:**
This is a 26-year-old Hispanic male who predominantly speaks English. He has been a patient at our clinic for approximately ten years, presenting today for follow-up management of his asthma. The patient reports that his asthma symptoms have been increasingly difficult to manage over the past month, especially with occurrences of acute bronchitis. He experiences shortness of breath and wheezing, intensified by physical exertion and during nighttime. His albuterol inhaler provides temporary relief.

In addition, the patient discusses episodes of depression, characterized by persistent low mood, loss of interest in daily activities, and social withdrawal. Despite ongoing use of antidepressants, these symptoms persist. No recent surgical interventions have been performed, and he has not noted significant side effects from his medications.

The patient lives with his family and is actively engaged in his community. He denies the use of tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs, and attempts to stay physically active and maintain a balanced diet. He also reports experiencing acute conjunctivitis occasionally and symptoms of allergic rhinitis, both of which exacerbate his respiratory condition.
