Subjective:
    - Chief Complaints & History of Present Illness:
        This is a 5-year-old Hispanic male who has been under our care for the past year and is here today for a follow-up visit regarding his asthma management. His mother reports that he has experienced increased coughing and wheezing over the last two days. Additionally, he had an episode of shortness of breath last night, which responded to his rescue inhaler. His asthma symptoms seem to be triggered by recent activities at his preschool and exposure to cold air. There have been no hospitalizations or emergency visits since the last follow-up. 
    - Past Medical & Surgical History:
        The patient has a history of asthma and multiple respiratory infections including bronchitis and pneumonia. He has also experienced gastrointestinal issues, such as noninfectious gastroenteritis.
    - Medications & Supplements:
        He is currently on albuterol (as needed), montelukast daily, and a fluticasone inhaler twice daily. His mother ensures adherence to this regimen, and they have noticed a general reduction in acute asthma episodes since starting the montelukast.

        The patient lives with his parents and two siblings in a smoke-free environment. They have no pets. He is currently attending preschool.

        Symptoms of increased coughing started two days ago, particularly noted with physical activities. Nighttime coughing is causing sleep disturbances. Wheezing and dyspnea occurred last night but improved significantly with the use of albuterol.
    - Additional Narrative:
        The mother has been using a cold mist humidifier in his room and making sure he stays hydrated. No recent changes in appetite or weight, and no fever has been noted. The family is coping well but is concerned about frequent respiratory symptoms despite medication adherence.
