This is a 72-year-old Indian male who has been receiving care at our clinic for over a decade, primarily communicating in Spanish. On August 26, 2009, he presented for a follow-up visit, reporting an exacerbation of his asthma symptoms. He experiences increased shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness, particularly at night, which has disrupted his sleep for the past week. The symptoms are temporarily alleviated by his albuterol inhaler, yet remain persistent. Additionally, he has nasal congestion and sneezing he attributes to allergic rhinitis.

His past medical history is significant for asthma, including various forms and triggers, such as allergic rhinitis, exercise-induced bronchospasm, and chronic bronchitis. Cardiovascular conditions include chronic ischemic heart disease, cardiomegaly, and coronary atherosclerosis. His history also includes eosinophilia, a benign neoplasm of the colon, contact dermatitis, fever, goiter, nontoxic multinodular goiter, gout, lumbar sprain, malignant neoplasm of the prostate, and chronic sinusitis. He has undergone notable surgical procedures, including a partial thyroidectomy and a radical prostatectomy.

In terms of medications, he is currently on a regimen that includes albuterol, Allegra, Cefazolin Sodium, Indocin, Midazolam Hydrochloride, and Uniserts. He quit smoking ten years ago, does not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs, and leads a relatively sedentary lifestyle due to respiratory limitations. He denies any known drug allergies and is currently managing an open finger wound.

**Objective:**

Vital signs at this visit were as follows:
- Blood Pressure: 148/92 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 82 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.4Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 94% on room air

On examination, he appeared well-developed and well-nourished without signs of acute distress. He was alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Peripheral pulses were strong and symmetrical.

The respiratory exam revealed bilateral wheezing with a prolonged expiratory phase and mild use of accessory muscles, but there was no severe respiratory distress.

The abdominal exam was unremarkable, with a soft, non-tender abdomen, no hepatosplenomegaly, and normoactive bowel sounds.

Musculoskeletal examination showed no joint deformities, swelling, or tenderness. There was a normal range of motion in all joints.

The neurological exam demonstrated intact cranial nerves II-XII, normal strength, sensation, and reflexes with no focal deficits.

The skin examination indicated no rashes or lesions, and the open wound on his finger was healing appropriately without signs of infection.

Recent laboratory results indicated:
- Normal albumin, bilirubin, BUN, calcium, thyroid function tests (TSH and T4), blood glucose, HCT, HGB, RBC, and WBC, all within normal limits.

**Assessment:**

1. Asthma, unspecified type, with acute exacerbation
   - The patient is experiencing an exacerbation of chronic asthma with nocturnal symptoms indicating poor control.
   
2. Allergic rhinitis
   - Managed with ongoing symptomatic treatment.
   
3. Obstructive chronic bronchitis with acute exacerbation
   - Correlated with frequent asthma exacerbations.
   
4. Chronic ischemic heart disease and cardiomegaly
   - Currently stable with ongoing management.
   
5. Nontoxic multinodular goiter
   - Stable following partial thyroidectomy.
   
6. Open wound on finger
   - Healing without complications.

**Plan:**

1. Asthma:
   - Increase the use of the albuterol inhaler as needed.
   - Prescribe a corticosteroid inhaler (fluticasone) for better management of chronic symptoms.
   - Recommend non-pharmacologic strategies, including breathing exercises.
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess asthma control. Consider pulmonology referral if symptoms persist or worsen.

2. Allergic rhinitis:
   - Continue with antihistamines as needed.
   - Prescribe a nasal corticosteroid spray if symptoms persist.

3. Obstructive chronic bronchitis:
   - Continue using inhaled bronchodilators to manage exacerbation.
   - Monitor for signs of infection or additional exacerbations.

4. Chronic ischemic heart disease:
   - Maintain current medication regimen and management.
   - Regular follow-up with cardiology for monitoring and necessary adjustments.

5. Nontoxic multinodular goiter:
   - Monitor thyroid function tests regularly.
   - Continue consultation with endocrinology for long-term management.

6. Open wound on finger:
   - Continue local wound care.
   - Follow up in one week to monitor healing, return earlier if signs of infection occur.

**Follow-Up:**

The patient was instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or based on test results indicating the need for further evaluation. The importance of adhering to asthma medication and recognizing signs of exacerbation was emphasized. The patient confirmed understanding and agreement with the outlined plan. 

A follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks, or sooner if there are significant changes in his condition.
