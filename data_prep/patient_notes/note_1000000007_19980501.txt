Subjective:
    This is an 18-year-old Asian male who presents today, 05/01/1998, for evaluation of an abrasion or friction burn on his face, neck, and scalp which occurred recently. He primarily speaks Spanish. The patient reports that the injury happened yesterday during a fall while playing soccer. He states that the abrasion is causing mild irritation but denies any signs of infection such as increased redness, swelling, warmth, or discharge.

    His past medical history includes occasional asthma, which he manages with an inhaler as needed, but is otherwise notable for good general health. He has no history of surgeries. 

    Currently, he is not on any routine medications except for his asthma inhaler. He denies using any herbal supplements.

    The patient has no known allergies.

    Symptoms include visible redness and superficial abrasions on the face and neck, specifically along the cheek and forehead. The abrasion is described as stinging and tender to touch, particularly when cleaning the area. He has tried cleaning the wound with water and applying a topical antibiotic.

            Cleanse the area with mild soap and water twice daily and keep it dry. Apply a topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., Neosporin) and cover with a sterile bandage. Reassess for signs of infection. Avoid further trauma to the area.
