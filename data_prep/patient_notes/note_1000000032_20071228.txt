This is an 11-year-old Indian girl who has been receiving care at our clinic for various respiratory-related conditions and routine child health check-ups. She speaks Spanish and is accompanied by her mother for this follow-up visit on December 28, 2007. The patient has a history of asthma, acute bronchiolitis, acute nasopharyngitis, and other respiratory abnormalities. 

Subjective:
The patient presents today with complaints of worsening nasal congestion, a progressive runny nose, persistent cough, and intermittent breathing difficulties over the past week. These symptoms align with her history of asthma, which has been variably documented as unspecified, sometimes with status asthmaticus. In addition to asthma, she has a history of episodes of acute nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, croup, and cystic fibrosis. Currently, she is maintained on a daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid for asthma control and utilizes a short-acting bronchodilator as a rescue measure. For her present respiratory symptoms, she is using an over-the-counter antihistamine and saline nasal drops. Socially, she lives with her parents who do not smoke, ensuring an environment free from tobacco exposure. She attends school regularly. No allergies are reported other than her respiratory conditions. Symptom onset was about one week ago, beginning with nasal congestion and a productive cough predominately at night. Although her breathing is succinctly stable, she experiences episodes of wheezing.

Objective:
Vital signs measured during the visit include a blood pressure of 102/64 mmHg, a heart rate of 105 bpm, a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient appears well-nourished, alert, and active without acute distress. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular heart sounds without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Respiratory exam notes mild nasal congestion; lung auscultation demonstrates clear breath sounds bilaterally without wheezing or crackles and normal respiratory effort. The abdominal examination shows a soft abdomen, non-tender with normal bowel sounds, and no organomegaly. Musculoskeletal examination confirms normal range of motion in all extremities, and the patient appears physically well. Neurologically, she is appropriate for her age, interactive, and cooperative. Her skin examination is unremarkable, presenting no rashes or lesions.

Assessment:
The clinical impression currently identifies three main concerns:
1. Acute nasopharyngitis (common cold).
2. Asthma, unspecified type, without mention of status asthmaticus.
3. Routine child health check.

Plan:
To address these concerns, the plan includes continuing the use of over-the-counter antihistamines and saline nasal drops to ease nasal symptoms, increasing fluid intake, and ensuring adequate rest. Symptom monitoring should be robust, with vigilance for any sign suggesting secondary infection or asthma exacerbation, such as persistent high fever, worsening cough, or increased respiratory distress. Reinforcement of the existing asthma management plan is critical, stressing the adherence to the daily inhaled corticosteroid and the as-needed correct use of the rescue inhaler. Educational emphasis will be placed on recognizing warning symptoms of respiratory distress and the necessity of prompt follow-up care when required. A return visit is scheduled for two weeks, unless symptoms worsen, indicating the need for earlier review. Instruct the mother to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen, or if expected improvement does not manifest in a week. The family understands and agrees with the provided plan and instructions. The need for emergent follow-up care or monitoring has been explained, along with instructions on follow-up for persistent, changing, or worsening symptoms.
