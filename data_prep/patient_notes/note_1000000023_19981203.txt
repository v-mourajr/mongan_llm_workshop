This is a case presentation for a 23-year-old Hispanic male who has been under our care. He speaks English and has been receiving regular follow-up at our clinic. He presented on December 3, 1998, for a routine check-up and to address several concerns.

**Subjective:**
The patient’s primary complaint today is intermittent abdominal pain and nausea, occasionally accompanied by vomiting. This has been present for the past two weeks and does not seem to be triggered by any specific food items or activities. The abdominal pain is diffuse and does not localize to any particular area. It is described as cramping in nature and ranges in severity from mild to moderate. Over-the-counter antacids and ibuprofen have provided partial relief but the symptoms recur. He also mentions experiencing a persistent cough over the past few days, likely due to a recent upper respiratory infection. His cough is non-productive and occasionally worsens at night. He has no history of smoking or alcohol use. 

His past medical history is notable for essential hypertension managed with lifestyle modifications and occasional use of antihypertensive medication. He denies any previous surgeries.

He is currently taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily for his hypertension and reports good compliance with this medication. He denies any known allergies.

**Objective:**
On physical examination, vital signs show a blood pressure of 128/82 mmHg, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 98.6°F. His oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

**General Appearance:**
The patient appears well-nourished, in no acute distress, and is alert and oriented.

**Cardiovascular:**
The cardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. There is no evidence of jugular venous distension or peripheral edema.

**Respiratory:**
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. 

**Abdomen:**
The abdomen is soft and non-distended with normal bowel sounds. There is mild, diffuse tenderness without rebound or guarding. No hepatosplenomegaly or palpable masses are noted.

**Musculoskeletal:**
No joint tenderness, swelling, or deformities were found. The range of motion in all joints is intact.

**Neurological:**
Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact. Motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities, and deep tendon reflexes are normal.

**Skin:**
There are no rashes, lesions, or signs of infection.

Laboratory studies from his last encounter included a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel, both of which were largely unremarkable, except for slightly elevated liver enzymes (AST). Urinalysis revealed the presence of trace ketones and protein, but no signs of infection.

**Assessment and Plan:**

1. **Abdominal Pain and Gastroenteritis:**
The likely diagnosis is nonspecific gastroenteritis given the symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Differential diagnoses include gastritis or peptic ulcer disease.
- **Diagnostic Tests:** Plan for an abdominal ultrasound and an upper GI endoscopy to evaluate for possible peptic ulcer disease.
- **Treatment Plan:** Initiate a trial of proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) and antiemetics (ondansetron) for symptomatic relief. Advise continuing the use of over-the-counter antacids as needed. 
- **Follow-Up:** Patient to return if symptoms worsen or in 2 weeks for further evaluation.

2. **Upper Respiratory Infection with Cough:**
Likely viral in origin given the acute presentation without bacterial symptoms.
- **Diagnostic Tests:** No further testing needed at this time unless symptoms persist.
- **Treatment Plan:** Supportive care recommended including increased fluids, rest, and the use of over-the-counter cough suppressants as needed.
- **Follow-Up:** Advise follow-up if the cough does not improve within one week. If symptoms persist, consider a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia.

3. **Hypertension:**
Currently well-controlled on hydrochlorothiazide.
- **Diagnostic Tests:** Routine blood pressure monitoring.
- **Treatment Plan:** Continue hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily and stress the importance of maintaining a low-sodium diet and regular exercise.
- **Follow-Up:** Routine 3-monthly follow-up to monitor blood pressure control and reinforce lifestyle modifications.

**Follow-Up:**
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed. Ensure the patient understands the importance of adherence to the treatment plan and follows up in 2 weeks for abdominal symptoms reassessment.

The patient was educated on the importance of staying hydrated, continuing his medications, and recognizing signs that warrant immediate medical attention such as severe pain, persistent vomiting, or breathing difficulties. He verbalized his understanding and expressed his commitment to complying with the recommended management plan.
