Visit Information:
- Patient Number: 1000000064
- Visit Date: 12/13/2001

Subjective:
This is an 18-year-old Asian male who primarily speaks Spanish and has been under our care since birth. He is here for follow-up after his last visit three months ago. The main reason for today's visit is ongoing management of his chronic musculoskeletal issues and follow-up for specific developmental learning difficulties. The patient reports intermittent headaches that seem to be tension-related and are usually alleviated with rest and over-the-counter analgesics. He has had a few instances of acute pharyngitis and acute laryngitis in the past but reports no recent episodes.

The patient's relevant medical history includes cervicalgia, low back pain associated with a prior unspecified back injury, and past fractures of both the carpal bone and radius which have since healed. He also had an uncomplicated open wound of the lip that is no longer symptomatic. The patient continues to remain active, engaging regularly in soccer, but mentions occasional knee pain and mild acne that he manages with proper hygiene.

He is not currently taking any prescribed medications, herbal supplements, or over-the-counter drugs regularly. The patient maintains a healthy lifestyle and follows a balanced diet. He denies smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. His support system is strong at home and within his educational environment, which plays a crucial role in managing his learning difficulties.

The patient has no known allergies, and his symptoms, which include musculoskeletal pain and headaches, have been managed conservatively. He remarked that the knee pain exacerbates with increased physical activity but improves with rest, ice application, and elevation.
