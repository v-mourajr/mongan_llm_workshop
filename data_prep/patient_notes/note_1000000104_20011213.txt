This is a 23-year-old Hispanic male who speaks English and has been receiving care at our clinic. Today, he presents for follow-up on his asthma management.

Subjective:
The patient mentions experiencing increased wheezing and shortness of breath over the past week, particularly at night. He has been compliant with his current asthma medications, which include an albuterol inhaler used as needed and a daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid. He reports using the rescue inhaler 3-4 times per day over the past week, which is more frequent than usual. There is also a history of acute pharyngitis, but no recent complaints of sore throat or fever. 

The patient does not have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors. He denies recent travel or exposure to respiratory irritants. His social history reveals that he lives with his parents and does not smoke or drink alcohol. He is a college student and is currently under treatment for attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity. He is also attentive to oral health, having undergone a dental examination recently.

Objective:
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 118/76 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 86 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
- Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air

Physical Examination:
- General Appearance: The patient appears well-developed, well-nourished, and in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented.
- Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 noted with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
- Respiratory: Breath sounds are diminished with expiratory wheezes bilaterally. There are no crackles. The use of accessory muscles is noted.
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, with no organomegaly.
- Musculoskeletal: Normal range of motion, no deformities or tenderness.
- Neurological: Alert and oriented, no focal deficits observed.
- Skin: No rashes or lesions.

Recent lab results revealed normal findings, including bilirubin, glucose, and protein levels. There were no abnormalities in the urinalysis, including ketones, nitrites, and specific gravity. Hematocrit and white blood cell screen were within normal ranges, indicating no signs of infection or anemia.

Assessment:
The patient’s primary diagnosis remains asthma, which is unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus. The exacerbation of his symptoms suggests a need to evaluate and potentially adjust his current asthma management plan. Secondary issues to be considered include acute pharyngitis, which appears to be resolved, and attention deficit disorder, currently stable under treatment.

Plan:
1. Asthma:
   - Increase the dose of the inhaled corticosteroid.
   - Continue using the albuterol inhaler as needed.
   - Continue monitoring peak expiratory flow rates at home.
   - Referral to a pulmonologist if symptoms do not improve within a week.

2. Acute Pharyngitis:
   - No current treatment needed, as there are no active symptoms.

3. Attention Deficit Disorder:
   - Continue current management and follow up with routine visits for monitoring.

Follow-Up:
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week. Educate the patient on the importance of adhering to the prescribed asthma management plan and avoiding known triggers. Schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to reassess asthma control and evaluate the effectiveness of the adjusted treatment regimen. 

Patient Education & Understanding of the Plan:
The patient verbalized understanding of the treatment plan, the need for medication adherence, and the importance of follow-up care. He was also advised to maintain good oral hygiene and to continue attending regular dental check-ups.
