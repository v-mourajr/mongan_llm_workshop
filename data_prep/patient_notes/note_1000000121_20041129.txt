This is a 43-year-old Black male who primarily speaks German and has been receiving care at our clinic since April 21, 1997. He presents today, November 29, 2004, for a follow-up visit concerning his ongoing issues with asthma.

**Subjective:**
The patient reports an exacerbation of his asthma symptoms over the past week, particularly at night. He describes experiencing shortness of breath, wheezing, and a persistent cough that has become moderately severe. Despite using his inhaled corticosteroids and short-acting beta agonist inhaler as prescribed, the relief he achieves is only partial. He notes increased fatigue but denies any recent upper respiratory infections or exposure to known allergens.

The patient has a long-standing history of asthma and has required several adjustments to his medication regimen. He is currently on inhaled corticosteroids, a short-acting beta agonist for rescue, and a leukotriene receptor antagonist. He adheres strictly to his medication schedule but continues to experience nocturnal symptoms that disrupt his sleep.

The patient’s past medical history is significant for asthma, requiring routine follow-up and medication management. He also has a history of osteoarthritis and dislocation of the patella, which led to surgical intervention years ago.

Regarding social history, the patient is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol or use illicit drugs. He works as a software engineer and mentions that work-related stress might worsen his asthma symptoms. He lives alone and has a predominantly sedentary lifestyle.

The patient denies any known drug allergies.

He describes his symptoms as including shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing, especially at night. These symptoms have been persistent for the past week, are constant, and vary in severity from moderate to severe, temporarily alleviated by his rescue inhaler.

The patient has tried non-pharmacological interventions such as using a humidifier and keeping windows closed during allergy season, with limited success. He has not experienced significant side effects from his medications but notes a slight worsening of symptoms since his last visit.

**Objective:**
- **Vital Signs:** Blood Pressure: 128/84 mmHg | Heart Rate: 80 bpm | Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute | Temperature: 98.6°F | Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air.
  
- **General Appearance:** The patient appears well-groomed and in no acute distress.

- **Cardiovascular:** Heart rate is regular with normal S1 and S2 sounds. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops are heard, and there is no jugular venous distension or peripheral edema.

- **Respiratory:** Bilateral wheezes are auscultated, with a prolonged expiratory phase. No crackles or rhonchi are noted. Mild intercostal retractions are present.

- **Abdomen:** The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly is detected.

- **Musculoskeletal:** Normal range of motion and strength in all extremities. No swelling or tenderness in joints.

- **Neurological:** The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. Motor and sensory examinations are normal.

- **Skin:** The skin is normal in texture and color, without rashes, lesions, or cyanosis.

**Laboratory Data:**
Laboratory results show normal eosinophil counts, but an elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) indicating systemic inflammation. Hematological parameters, including Hemoglobin (HGB), Hematocrit (HCT), and White Blood Cell (WBC) counts, are within normal ranges.

**Assessment:**
The primary diagnosis remains persistent asthma, with symptoms suggesting a nocturnal variant possibly worsened by work-related stress. A secondary concern involves suspected allergic triggers contributing to his asthma exacerbations.

**Plan:**
1. **Asthma Management:**
   - Continue with current inhaled corticosteroid and short-acting beta-agonist regimen.
   - Increase the dose of inhaled corticosteroids.
   - Initiate a trial of a long-acting beta agonist inhaler.
   - Schedule pulmonary function tests to assess the degree of airway obstruction.
   
2. **Symptom Monitoring and Management:**
   - Maintain a symptom diary to track potential asthma triggers.
   - Encourage the use of non-pharmacological measures, such as an air filtration system.

3. **Referrals:**
   - Refer to a pulmonologist for comprehensive asthma management.
   - Consider allergy testing to identify specific allergens contributing to asthma symptoms.

4. **Education:**
   - Instruct the patient in proper inhaler technique and stress the importance of adherence to prescribed medications.
   - Advise the patient to seek urgent care if symptoms escalate to severe respiratory distress or if there is no improvement.

**Follow-Up:**
- The patient is advised to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results necessitate further evaluation.
- Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to reassess asthma control and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
- Ensure that the patient understands and agrees with the treatment plan.
