On 11/17/1998, an 11-year-old Black male, who has been receiving care at our clinic, presented for a follow-up visit. The patient is monolingual, speaking only Spanish, and has been monitored by our team for a period of approximately 1.5 years. His chart includes a primary diagnosis of unspecified asthma without mention of status asthmaticus, and secondary diagnoses include various congenital and acquired conditions affecting his respiratory and neurological systems.

**Subjective:**
The patient’s mother reports that he continues to experience occasional wheezing and shortness of breath, especially during physical activity. Over the past few weeks, she has noticed that his symptoms seem more pronounced during the early morning and night, which wakes him up and interrupts his sleep. She also mentions that he requires the use of a bronchodilator about three times per week. His history includes congenital anomalies of the diaphragm, leading to moderate respiratory distress. He has a dependence on a respirator occasionally during severe episodes.

Additionally, the patient has a history of multiple upper respiratory infections, and his mother notes that he has had episodes of otitis media, but no recent occurrences. He takes an inhaled corticosteroid daily to manage his asthma symptoms, which his mother confirms has reduced the frequency of his exacerbations. There have been no recent changes in his condition or new symptoms. 

**Objective:**
Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, a temperature of 98.6°F, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. 

Upon physical examination, the patient appears to be in no acute distress, is well-nourished, and alert. His cardiovascular examination reveals regular heart sounds with no murmurs. Respiratory examination shows mild wheezing on expiration and slightly prolonged expiratory phase. There are no signs of retractions or nasal flaring. Abdominal examination indicates no hepatosplenomegaly, and the overall examination is benign without tenderness or masses. A brief neurological examination revealed no focal deficits, and cranial nerves are intact. His skin is unremarkable with no rashes or lesions.

Relevant laboratory findings include consistent monitoring of complete blood count parameters, which show a slight elevation in eosinophils but are otherwise unremarkable. Previous anisocytosis and hypochromia indicative of some mild anemic tendencies have been stable without significant change.

**Assessment:**
The clinical impression includes the continued management of his primary asthma condition, which is likely triggered by environmental factors. Secondary issues are related to his congenital diaphragmatic anomaly and periodic otitis media.

**Plan:**
1. Asthma:
   - Continue the current inhaled corticosteroid regimen.
   - Increased monitoring of symptom frequency and potential environmental triggers.
   - Add a leukotriene receptor antagonist as a daily medication to better control nighttime symptoms.
   - Referral to a pulmonologist to reassess any need for further intervention including potential adjustment of his therapeutic plan.

2. Congenital Diaphragmatic Anomaly:
   - Ensure regular follow-up with a pediatric surgeon and pulmonologist.
   - Continue use of a respirator as needed during severe respiratory episodes.

3. Otitis Media:
   - Monitor for signs of acute infection and treat with antibiotics as necessary.
   - Referral to an ENT specialist if symptomatic episodes persist.

Lastly, instructions are given for the patient’s mother to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed. Patient education included discussions on recognizing early signs of exacerbation and the importance of adherence to the current asthma management plan, ensuring the mother understands and agrees with the plan moving forward. Follow-up is scheduled in one month to evalulate the effectiveness of the new treatment additions and to monitor symptom progress.
