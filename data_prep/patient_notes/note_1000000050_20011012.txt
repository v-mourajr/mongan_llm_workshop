Visit Information:
- Patient Num: 1000000050
- Visit Date: 10/12/2001

Subjective:
This is a 13-year-old Black female who has been receiving ongoing care at our clinic for the past three years, primarily for the management of her asthma. She presents today for a routine follow-up. Her first language is German. Over the past few weeks, she has experienced increased episodes of dyspnea and wheezing, exacerbated by physical activity. These episodes have been partially managed at home using a prescribed rescue inhaler.

Her past medical history includes diagnoses of unspecified asthma without mention of status asthmaticus, recurrent pneumonia of unspecified origin, and episodes of pulmonary collapse. She has also had occurrences of pleural effusion and respiratory distress syndrome in the past. There is no record of significant surgical history or known drug allergies.

Currently, she is on a maintenance regimen that includes a combination inhaler with a corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist. The family employs various non-pharmacological strategies to manage her condition, including maintaining a clean, dust-free environment and avoiding triggers such as cold air and allergens.

Objective:
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 110/75 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 88 beats per minute
- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.6Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

General Appearance:
The patient appears alert and in no acute distress. She is well-nourished and dressed appropriately for the weather.

Cardiovascular:
Heart sounds are clear and regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs detected.

Respiratory:
Bilateral mild expiratory wheezes are present. No signs of acute respiratory distress or use of accessory muscles are noted. Breath sounds are clear in the upper lobes; however, diminished airflow is noted in the lower lobes.

Abdomen:
The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and without hepatosplenomegaly.

Musculoskeletal:
No abnormalities detected. The patient has full range of motion in all extremities without pain.

Neurological:
The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact, and there are no focal neurological deficits.

Skin:
There are no rashes, lesions, or signs of cyanosis or clubbing.

Assessment:
The primary diagnosis remains asthma, unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus. Secondary considerations include her history of dyspnea and other respiratory issues, including pulmonary insufficiency. Recurrent pneumonia and episodes of pulmonary collapse are significant and may require further evaluation to understand underlying causes and optimize management.

Plan:
1. Asthma Management:
   - Continue the current use of the combination inhaler per prescribed regimen.
   - Emphasize the importance of adherence to the inhaler medication and the correct use of the rescue inhaler during exacerbations.
   - Consider the addition of a short course of oral corticosteroids if asthma control remains inadequate.
   - Referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management recommendations, given the history of recurrent respiratory issues.

2. Diagnostic Tests:
   - Order a chest X-ray to rule out any current infection or assess for structural abnormalities contributing to her recurrent pulmonary problems.
   - Perform repeat pulmonary function tests to evaluate current asthma control and lung function.
   - Routine blood work, including a complete blood count and liver function tests, to monitor for any systemic issues and potential medication side effects.

3. Follow-Up:
   - Instruct the patient and her family to monitor her symptoms closely and report any increase in severity or frequency of asthma exacerbations, or the emergence of new symptoms.
   - Schedule regular follow-ups every three months, or sooner if symptom control is not achieved.
   - Advise the patient and family to contact the clinic immediately if symptoms worsen or fail to improve within a week or if test results necessitate further evaluation.

Patient Education & Understanding of the Plan:
The patient and her family were educated on the importance of continued adherence to the medication regimen, recognizing early symptoms of asthma exacerbations, and following the action plan provided. The family demonstrated understanding and agreed with the proposed care plan.

The visit is concluded, and the patient is expected to return for follow-up as scheduled. Immediate contact with the clinic is advised should there be any concerning changes in her condition.
