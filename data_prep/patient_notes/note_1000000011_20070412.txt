This is a 59-year-old White female who has been under the care of our clinic since August 6, 1998, presenting today on April 12, 2007, for a follow-up regarding her chronic asthma and other recurrent health issues. She speaks English and lives an active lifestyle working in an office environment.

She currently reports an increase in asthma symptoms, including frequent wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, exacerbated by both physical exertion and exposure to environmental triggers. She uses her rescue inhaler daily with temporary symptomatic relief. In addition to her respiratory concerns, she notes episodes of abdominal discomfort over the past fortnight, described as intermittent lower quadrant cramping without changes in bowel habits.

The patient’s medical history is significant for recurrent and chronic asthma, acute bronchitis, acute sinusitis, aspergillosis, various gynecological conditions including carcinoma in situ of the cervix uteri, dysplasia of the cervix, malignant neoplasm of the ovary, and leiomyomas of the uterus. Musculoskeletal concerns include recurrent dislocation of the shoulder, osteoarthrosis, lumbar intervertebral disc displacement, lumbosacral spondylosis, and a history of total abdominal hysterectomy. She has also experienced depressive disorder and panic disorder in the past. 

Medications currently include a daily inhaled corticosteroid, a short-acting beta-agonist as needed for asthma, and occasional NSAIDs or steroid injections for back pain. She is compliant with her medications but seeks better control of her symptoms.

Socially, she occasionally drinks alcohol, does not smoke, and has an office-based job with limited exposure to asthma triggers. She has a known allergy to sulfonamides.

Vital signs are as follows:
- Blood Pressure: 120/78 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 74 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.6°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air

During the examination, the patient appeared well-nourished and in no acute distress. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular heart rate and rhythm, without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Respiratory assessment uncovered bilateral expiratory wheezes, no cyanosis, and no use of accessory muscles. The abdominal exam showed mild tenderness in the lower quadrants without palpable masses or organomegaly. Musculoskeletal examination was unchanged from previous visits, with no new abnormalities of the lumbar spine. Neurological and skin examinations were unremarkable.

Recent lab results include normal levels for basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCHC, MCH, and platelet counts were consistently within normal ranges.

### Assessment:
1. **Asthma**: Suboptimal control with increased frequency/severity of symptoms despite current medication regimen.
2. **Abdominal Discomfort**: Mild lower quadrant tenderness; differential includes gynecological vs. gastrointestinal origins, requiring further evaluation.
3. **Chronic Lumbar Pain**: Persistent, consistent with existing lumbar spine conditions.

### Plan:
1. **Asthma Management**:
    - Continuing the current inhaled corticosteroid regimen.
    - Increase the dosage of the inhaled corticosteroid.
    - Add a long-acting beta-agonist.
    - Provide patient education on avoiding triggers and inhaler technique.
    - Schedule a follow-up with a pulmonologist in 4 weeks.

2. **Abdominal Discomfort**:
    - Order an abdominal ultrasound.
    - Consider a CT scan if indicated by ultrasound results.
    - Review records of past gynecological surgeries.

3. **Chronic Lumbar Pain**:
    - Continue NSAIDs as needed.
    - Refer to physical therapy for a tailored exercise program.
    - Consult with a pain management specialist for potential additional steroid injections.

4. **Laboratory Monitoring**:
    - Repeat complete blood count and arterial blood gases.

### Follow-Up:
The patient is instructed to contact the clinic if asthma symptoms do not improve or worsen within a week. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for 2 weeks to reassess asthma management and review abdominal imaging results. She has been provided with educational materials on asthma management and has demonstrated an understanding of the treatment plan.
