This is a 64-year-old Asian male who has been under our care for approximately 10 years. He speaks English and presents today, 12/10/2007, for follow-up related to his asthma and several other conditions. His primary diagnosis is asthma, unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus. He has additional diagnoses including disorders of iron metabolism, dizziness and giddiness, malignant neoplasm of the prostate, osteoarthrosis involving multiple sites, and other primary cardiomyopathies.

Subjective:
The patient reports experiencing persistent asthma symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing, and predominantly nocturnal episodes. These symptoms have led to an increased reliance on his rescue inhaler over the past week. He continues to experience dizziness, persistent fatigue, and a general sense of malaise. A history of issues with iron metabolism has been noted, and recent labs have continued to monitor these parameters. Despite adhering to his prescribed treatment regimen, he feels that asthma control has not been optimal.

His medical history is significant for chronic persistent asthma and other primary cardiomyopathies. He has also been diagnosed with and treated for a malignant neoplasm of the prostate.

The patient is currently using a short-acting beta2 agonist inhaler, primarily at night, and a daily inhaled corticosteroid. In addition, he takes medications for his other cardiomyopathies, though specific medication names were not detailed beyond his asthma treatments. He maintains high compliance with his medication regimen, although symptom relief has recently been inconsistent.

Social history includes living alone and working as an accountant. He does not smoke and consumes alcohol occasionally. Physical activities have been limited due to his respiratory symptoms, and there are no known allergies.

He reports a significant increase in wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and identifies dust exposure as an exacerbating factor. He achieves some relief through medication use. No fever, chills, or abnormal sputum production have been indicated.

Objective:
- Vital Signs:
    - Blood Pressure: 140/85 mmHg
    - Heart Rate: 90 bpm
    - Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths per minute
    - Temperature: 98.8°F
    - Oxygen Saturation: 94% on room air
- General Appearance: The patient appears in mild distress due to breathing difficulties.
- Cardiovascular: The heart examination reveals a normal rhythm, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
- Respiratory: A notable prolonged expiratory phase with diffuse bilateral wheezes was observed. No crackles or rhonchi present, and slight use of accessory muscles was observed.
- Abdomen: The examination reveals a non-tender, soft abdomen with no organomegaly.
- Musculoskeletal: No peripheral edema; muscle bulk and tone are normal, and non-tender upon palpation.
- Neurological: The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact.
- Skin: Normal skin appearance with no rashes or lesions, and normal turgor observed.

Assessment:
Chronic persistent asthma with noted exacerbation, which is the primary focus of today's visit. Differential considerations include other primary lung diseases contributing to increased symptoms like dyspnea and wheezing. Additional issues involve disorders of iron metabolism, consistent with the patient’s history and contributing to persistent fatigue and general malaise. The nonspecific abnormal findings in prior lung examinations and existing cardiomyopathies necessitate ongoing monitoring.

Plan:
- Continue with the currently prescribed asthma medications.
- Initiate a short course of oral corticosteroids to address the acute asthma exacerbation.
- Schedule repeat spirometry to assess lung function and monitor the patient's response to current treatment.
- Consider referral to a pulmonologist if significant symptoms persist without improvement at the next review.
- Reinforce asthma education, including proper inhaler techniques and strategies to avoid known allergens and triggers.
- Emphasize the importance of regular follow-ups to ensure effective asthma management and reevaluate treatment as necessary.

Follow-Up:
- Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if any results from investigations suggest the need for further evaluation.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess symptoms and the effectiveness of the prescribed interventions.

The patient has demonstrated a clear understanding of the management plan and is committed to adhering to the recommendations provided.
