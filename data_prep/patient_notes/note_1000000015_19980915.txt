On 09/15/1998, a 21-year-old Hispanic male, who communicates in Spanish, presented to our clinic for his regularly scheduled follow-up visit. The patient has been under our care for a range of chronic and acute medical conditions over the past several months, including asthma and recurrent otitis media, both acute nonsuppurative and acute suppurative without spontaneous rupture of the eardrum. Additionally, he has experienced episodes of streptococcal sore throat.

During today's visit, the patient's chief complaints centered around persistent wheezing, episodes of chest tightness, and intermittent dyspnea, which have been recurrent since childhood and aggravated in recent weeks. The patient reported that these symptoms typically worsen during physical exertion and improve with rest. He has a history of utilizing rescue inhalers without consistent adherence to a long-term controller medication. The patient has not recently required emergency care for his asthma symptoms.

The patient's medication regimen includes a short-acting beta-agonist (albuterol) inhaler used as needed for acute asthma symptoms. He acknowledges forgetfulness in taking inhaled corticosteroids regularly and reports missing doses of his prescribed oral montelukast which he collects monthly. The patient denies current use of herbal supplements or any recent changes in medications.

His social history reveals he is a non-smoker, has minimal alcohol intake, and engages in physical activities within his community but finds asthma limits his abilities. No known allergies have been reported.

During the physical examination, the patient's vital signs were notable for a blood pressure of 118/76 mmHg, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, a temperature of 98.6°F, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient appeared well-nourished and in no acute distress, though mildly anxious about his symptoms. 

Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular heart rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. However, the respiratory examination disclosed bilateral wheezing, more pronounced in the upper lung fields, with no use of accessory muscles. The abdomen was soft, non-tender, and devoid of any hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal and neurological examinations were unremarkable, and the skin was clear without rashes or cyanosis.

Laboratory data indicate consistent liver and pancreatic function from previous visits, with ALT and Amylase levels within normal limits. Routine blood tests such as a complete blood count and urinalysis were within normal ranges barring slightly elevated eosinophils, which may correlate with his poorly controlled asthma.

In assessment, the patient’s symptoms are consistent with an exacerbation of asthma, potentially due to poor adherence to maintenance inhaled corticosteroids. His recurrent otitis media episodes and throat infections have been well-managed previously and are currently quiescent.

Our treatment plan includes:
1. Reinforcing the importance of daily inhaled corticosteroids and adherence to montelukast for asthma management.
2. Providing a prescription for a combination inhaler that includes both a long-acting beta-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid to improve compliance.
3. Scheduling a follow-up pulmonary function test to assess airflow limitation and tailor therapy accordingly.
4. Referral to an allergist for evaluation of potential allergens exacerbating his asthma.
5. Educating the patient on the use of a peak flow meter to monitor his condition and recognizing early signs of exacerbation.

The patient was instructed to contact the clinic if his symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if his test results indicate further evaluation is needed. A follow-up appointment was scheduled in 4 weeks to monitor progress and treatment adherence.

The patient demonstrated understanding of the management plan and agreed to maintain compliance with the prescribed treatment.
