This is a 36-year-old Asian male who has been receiving care at our clinic for nearly a decade. He speaks Spanish and presents today for follow-up related to ongoing issues primarily concerning his hand, reflecting the persistent impacts of a traumatic amputation and associated health complications.

Subjective:
Chief Complaints & History of Present Illness:
The patient reports persistent discomfort and functional limitations in his right hand following the traumatic amputation of multiple fingers due to an accident involving machinery in 2004. He continues to experience sharp, throbbing pain and intermittent numbness in his remaining fingers, which are aggravated by physical exertion and cold temperatures. These symptoms notably interfere with his daily routine and sleep quality.

Past Medical & Surgical History:
Notable medical history includes the traumatic amputation and subsequent surgical procedures for disarticulation of the right index and middle fingers. He has previously dealt with acute apical periodontitis, episodes of vertigo, and periodic sensorineural hearing loss.

Medications & Supplements:
The patient is currently managing his post-surgical pain with Acetaminophen, which provides moderate relief. He is also taking a daily multivitamin supplement and recently completed a course of Amoxicillin post-surgery. The patient reports no adverse reactions to these medications.

Social History:
The patient resides with his family and works as a machinist, the occupation responsible for his initial hand injury. He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol and maintains a health-conscious diet rich in fruits and vegetables. His physical activity remains limited due to recovery needs.

Allergies:
The patient has no known drug allergies.

Symptom Details:
Pain and numbness are commonly triggered by physical activity and cold exposure, with peak intensity observed at night, adversely affecting sleep. He has observed some improvement in hand functionality and strength through physical therapy, although significant discomfort persists.

Additional Narrative:
The patient has been adhering to a comprehensive rehabilitation plan, including the use of a custom hand brace and attending physical therapy sessions twice weekly. He continues to manage his condition effectively, with some reported improvement in hand strength and function, despite persistent pain and numbness. Compliance with medication and non-pharmacological treatments has been optimal.
