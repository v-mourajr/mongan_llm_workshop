On June 9, 2003, a 7-year-old Hispanic boy who speaks German was brought to our clinic by his guardians for a follow-up on his recent health issues, primarily asthma. The patient has been under our care for his breathing problems for some months now, and this visit is aimed at assessing his current health status related to this chronic condition.

### Subjective:
The guardians report that the patient's asthma has been somewhat controlled with the use of his daily medications but express concern over occasional exacerbations that have occurred over the past few weeks, particularly at night. He has been compliant with his inhaled corticosteroid and short-acting bronchodilator regimen. The child's guardians notice that his symptoms worsen with physical activity and exposure to allergens such as pollen and dust. 

He denies any chest pain but occasionally experiences difficulty in catching his breath, particularly during playtime. There is no history of fever, weight loss, or night sweats. His past medical history is significant for asthma diagnosed at the age of 5. He has no past surgical history. 

The patient is currently taking Beclomethasone (80 mcg) as an inhaler twice daily and Albuterol (90 mcg) as a rescue inhaler used as needed, typically once a week. His guardians note that the medications have been relatively effective, but they are seeking strategies to manage his symptoms better during the night.

There are no known allergies. The patient lives with his parents and two siblings in a smoke-free home. He attends school and participates in physical activities when possible but has limitations due to breathing difficulties. The family recently adopted a cat, but no direct correlation with symptom exacerbation has been noted.

### Objective:
- **Vital Signs:**
  - Blood Pressure: 110/70 mmHg
  - Heart Rate: 98 bpm
  - Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths per minute
  - Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
  - Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air
  
- **General Appearance:**
  The patient appears well-nourished and in no acute distress. He is alert and cooperative during the examination.

- **Cardiovascular:**
  Heart sounds are normal with a regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops are noted.

- **Respiratory:**
  Mild wheezing is detected on auscultation bilaterally, particularly in the upper lobes. There are no crackles or rhonchi.

- **Abdomen:**
  Soft, non-tender, without hepatosplenomegaly.

- **Musculoskeletal:**
  Normal range of motion, no joint swelling or tenderness.

- **Neurological:**
  The patient is oriented, with normal cranial nerve function and no motor or sensory deficits.

- **Skin:**
  No rashes, lesions, or discoloration observed.

Recently conducted laboratory tests have shown values within normal limits for Absolute Lymphocytes, Bands, Basophils, Bilirubin, Color, Eosinophils, Glucose, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Ketones, Lymphocytes, Mean Corpuscular Volume, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration, Microcytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils, Nitrites, Occult Blood, pH, Platelets, Protein, Red Blood Cells, Red Cell Distribution Width, Specific Gravity, Turbidity, and White Blood Cells, confirming no underlying acute issues or deviations.

### Assessment:
1. **Primary Diagnosis:**
   - Asthma, chronic, with nocturnal and exercise-induced exacerbations.
2. **Secondary Diagnoses:**
   - No additional secondary diagnoses were noted during this visit.

### Plan:
1. **Asthma Management:**
   - Continue with current medications: Beclomethasone inhaler twice daily and Albuterol inhaler as needed.
   - Initiate Montelukast (4 mg chewable tablet) once daily in the evening to help with nighttime symptoms.
   - Education on allergen avoidance, particularly with recently adopted pets, and strategies to minimize allergens in the home.

2. **Follow-Up:**
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess the effectiveness of the new medication regimen and address any ongoing concerns.
   - Encourage the patient’s guardians to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week. Immediate care should be sought if the patient experiences severe respiratory distress, increased use of rescue inhaler, or any other concerning symptoms.

3. **Patient Education:**
   - Provided education on proper inhaler techniques and the importance of adherence to prescribed treatments.
   - Discussed the potential side effects of Montelukast and the need to monitor for any behavioral changes.

The patient and his guardians have demonstrated understanding of the new plan and expressed commitment to follow the recommendations provided.
