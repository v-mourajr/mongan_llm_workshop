This is a 35-year-old Black male who has been receiving care at our clinic for approximately 10 years. He speaks English and presents today, June 16, 2010, for a follow-up related to his chronic respiratory issues, primarily asthma. The patient reports experiencing increasingly frequent episodes of shortness of breath and wheezing over the past month, particularly at night and with physical exertion. Despite adherence to his prescribed asthma medications, he has used his rescue inhaler multiple times over the past week. He expresses concern regarding his poor respiratory control but denies any recent hospitalizations or significant illnesses aside from minor colds.

Subjective:
    The patient’s past medical history is notable for chronic asthma, with additional diagnoses including acute bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, and multiple upper respiratory infections. He also has a history of adjustment disorder with emotional features and past substance abuse involving alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine. He reports that he has quit all substances and currently denies any use other than occasional social consumption of alcohol.

    Current medications include an inhaled corticosteroid (Flovent) and a long-acting beta-agonist, which he uses daily, and albuterol as needed for acute symptoms. The patient also takes Allegra for allergic rhinitis and uses Benzamycin gel for his skin condition. He does not have known allergies to medications. He works a physically demanding job, which he believes may contribute to his exacerbated respiratory symptoms. The patient lives alone and maintains a relatively structured lifestyle, ensuring he attends regular medical checkups. He describes difficulty managing stress, which he feels impacts his overall health and asthma control.

        Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops present. There is no peripheral edema.

    Respiratory:
        Lung examination reveals mild wheezing in all lung fields on auscultation. The patient reports mild dyspnea on exertion. No crackles or rhonchi are observed, suggesting no infection or severe exacerbation currently.

    Skin:
        Skin appears warm, dry, and intact, with no rashes or lesions present.

Assessment:
    Chronic asthma with suboptimal control is the primary issue, evidenced by frequent night-time symptoms and increased use of the rescue inhaler. Contributing factors include environmental triggers, physical exertion, and emotional stress from his adjustment disorder. His history of substance abuse is a relevant consideration in his overall health, though he denies current use.

Plan:
    - Continue current regimen for asthma management, including inhaled corticosteroid (Flovent) and long-acting beta-agonist.
    - Prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) to manage the acute exacerbation of asthma symptoms.
    - Review and educate the patient on proper inhaler technique and emphasize the importance of medication adherence.
    - Initiate peak flow monitoring to better assess and manage asthma control.
    - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to re-evaluate asthma control and symptom management.
    - Refer the patient to a mental health professional to address the adjustment disorder and develop effective stress-coping strategies.
    - Offer continued support for substance abuse counseling to help maintain abstinence.
    - Encourage regular physical activity while advising the patient to avoid known asthma triggers.
    - Provide education on recognizing and avoiding environmental asthma triggers and reinforce the correct use of the rescue inhaler.

Follow-Up:
    The patient is instructed to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen, do not improve within a week, or if any test results suggest further evaluation is needed. A follow-up visit is scheduled for 6 weeks to reassess asthma control and emotional health. The patient acknowledges the plan and agrees to the proposed interventions.
