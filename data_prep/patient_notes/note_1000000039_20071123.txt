This is a 25-year-old White female who has been receiving care at our clinic for numerous medical issues, including asthma, for several years. She typically speaks German and presents today, November 23, 2007, for a follow-up visit focused predominantly on her recurrent asthma symptoms and associated chronic and acute complaints.

Subjective:
The patient reports ongoing episodic shortness of breath and wheezing that are most significant at night and during periods of physical exertion. These episodes necessitate her rescue inhaler use more frequently during high pollen seasons. Since her last visit, there have been no hospitalizations or emergency room visits for asthma. Although her inhaled medication regimen alleviates symptoms, its efficacy seems diminished during peak allergen exposure periods. She has no known allergies and does not take herbal supplements.

Her medical history includes allergic rhinitis related to multiple allergens, which exacerbate her asthma. Additionally, she reports recurring pain in the shoulder and cervical regions, which she describes as a dull ache, rated 4 out of 10 in intensity, and worsened by heavy activity. She has previously sustained abrasions on her elbows and forearms from minor injuries that have since healed completely.

Socially, the patient is a student living at home in a smoke-free environment. She refrains from alcohol, smoking, and illicit drug use. She mentions feeling stressed due to academic responsibilities but finds some relief in music and reading.

Objective:
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 110/70 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 78 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.4Â°F
- Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

General Appearance:
The patient appears well-nourished, alert, and in no acute distress.

Cardiovascular:
The cardiovascular exam reveals a regular heart rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

Respiratory:
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, except for mild end-expiratory wheezing on forced exhalation. No use of accessory muscles or retractions is noted.

Abdomen:
The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with normoactive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly or masses.

Musculoskeletal:
The musculoskeletal exam shows no acute swelling or erythema of the joints. There is palpable tenderness over the left shoulder and cervical region, with slightly reduced range of motion due to pain but no significant limitations. 

Neurological:
The neurological exam is unremarkable, with grossly intact cranial nerves II-XII and no focal deficits.

Skin:
The skin exam shows no new rashes or lesions. Healed abrasion sites on the elbows and forearms are noted, without signs of infection or irritation.

Assessment:
The patient's primary diagnosis remains asthma, which, while generally well-controlled with her long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid, is exacerbated by allergic rhinitis triggered by pollen and other allergens. Her asthma symptoms require close monitoring, especially during allergy season. Secondary complaints include musculoskeletal pain in the shoulder and cervical regions, likely aggravated by academic stress.

Plan:
1. **Asthma:**
   - Continue the current medication regimen with a long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid.
   - Use the rescue inhaler as needed.
   - Schedule pulmonary function tests to reassess baseline lung function and adjust treatment if necessary.
   - Recommend a flu vaccination and discuss strategies to minimize allergen exposure during peak seasons.

2. **Allergic Rhinitis:**
   - Continue antihistamines for symptom control.
   - Consider referral to an allergist if symptoms remain uncontrolled or adversely affect her quality of life.

3. **Cervicalgia and Shoulder Pain:**
   - Continue physical therapy exercises focusing on strengthening and stretching.
   - Use NSAIDs as needed for pain relief.
   - Consider referral to an orthopedic specialist if pain persists or worsens despite current measures.

4. **General Health:**
   - Recommend lifestyle modifications to manage academic stress, including relaxation techniques.
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in three months or sooner if new or worsening symptoms arise.

The patient understands and agrees with the proposed plan. She has been advised to contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is necessary.
