This is a 27-year-old Asian male who communicates primarily in Spanish and has been an established patient at our clinic for multiple years. He presents today for continued follow-up and comprehensive health evaluation due to ongoing musculoskeletal complaints and management of his previous medical conditions. 

Subjective:
The patient reports persistent but intermittent neck pain (cervical region) and lower back pain (lumbar spine) resulting from past injuries that he sustained in recreational activities. The pain is described as a dull ache, exacerbated by extended periods of physical exertion and alleviated with rest, application of ice, and over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications. Additionally, the patient occasionally experiences knee discomfort, particularly noticeable after playing soccer, which he manages through conservative means like rest and analgesics. He mentions having mild tension headaches about once or twice a week, which are relieved with rest and occasional use of non-prescription pain relief.

The patient's history includes several healed fractures to the carpal bones and radius, an uncomplicated laceration on the lip, and various minor sprains. He recounts an incident of acute alcoholic intoxication under continuous drinking behavior; however, he has since abstained from alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. He maintains a supportive family and educational environment, which aids in his management of developmental learning challenges. No past surgeries are documented apart from minor procedures associated with injury management. 

Currently, the patient does not take any prescribed medications or supplements. He adheres to good hygiene practices to manage mild acne and has no known allergies.
