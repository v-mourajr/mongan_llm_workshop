Visit Information:

Subjective:
This is an 18-year-old Indian male who speaks Spanish and has been receiving care at our clinic for asthma for the past few months. The primary reason for today's visit is a follow-up for asthma management. The patient reports experiencing intermittent episodes of wheezing and shortness of breath, particularly during the night. These symptoms have persisted since last visiting the clinic. He finds some relief from using his rescue inhaler, but he is concerned about the frequency of these episodes.

In terms of past medical history, he has been diagnosed with unspecified asthma, without mention of status asthmaticus. There are no notable surgical histories. Current medications include an albuterol inhaler (rescue inhaler), and he admits that he uses it more often than prescribed, which is every 4-6 hours as needed. The patient does not report any herbal supplements.

Regarding his social history, he is a high school student, lives with his parents, and does not smoke or drink alcohol. He is not currently involved in any physically demanding activities or sports. Allergies were not mentioned.

Currently, his symptoms include episodes of shortness of breath, intermittent wheezing, chest tightness, and a feeling of needing to clear his throat. These symptoms are typically aggravated by cold air and strenuous activities, and alleviated somewhat by rest and his rescue inhaler.

Objective:
Vital Signs:
- Blood Pressure: 110/70 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 82 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
- Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air

General Appearance: The patient appears alert and oriented, in no acute distress. He is well-nourished and well-developed.

Cardiovascular: Heart sounds are clear without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Regular rate and rhythm.

Respiratory: Lungs sound clear to auscultation bilaterally with mild wheezing noted on forced expiration. No rhonchi or crackles. The patient exhibits the use of accessory muscles for breathing.

Abdomen: Non-distended with normoactive bowel sounds. No tenderness on palpation.

Musculoskeletal: Normal range of motion with no joint swelling or tenderness.

Neurological: Patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. Motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities.

Skin: No rashes, lesions, or cyanosis.

Laboratory findings indicate tests conducted during the previous visit included monitoring hematologic parameters like hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets (PLT), all of which are within normal limits except signs of anisocytosis and polychromasia indicating some red blood cell variability. Coagulation tests (PT and PTT) are also within normal parameters.

Assessment:
This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with unspecified asthma, without mention of status asthmaticus, as there continue to be intermittent symptoms managed suboptimally with rescue inhaler use. His repeated visits and lab monitoring suggest a chronic condition that needs better control.

Plan:
1. Continue with the current albuterol inhaler but emphasize the importance of not overusing it to avoid tachyphylaxis.
2. Commence a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as a long-term control medication to reduce nighttime symptoms and decrease the frequency of rescue inhaler use.
3. Schedule pulmonary function tests (spirometry) to assess the severity of the asthma and guide more targeted therapy.
4. Educate the patient on asthma triggers, including cold air and exercise, and strategies to avoid them.
5. Refer to an asthma educator for a more detailed action plan and potential adjustment in medication strategy such as the addition of a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) for better symptom management.
6. Arrange for a follow-up appointment in two months to reassess symptom control and review spirometry results.

Follow-Up:
Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed. Review inhaler technique during the follow-up and reinforce the proper use of medications. Ensure the patient understands the plan fully and adheres to prescribed preventive measures for optimal asthma management.
