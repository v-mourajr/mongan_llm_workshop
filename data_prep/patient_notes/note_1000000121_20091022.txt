**Subjective:**
This is a 49-year-old Black male who has been under care at our clinic for several years, with a primary diagnosis of asthma. Today, he presents for a follow-up visit, reporting an exacerbation of his asthma symptoms over the last week. The patient, a native German speaker, describes experiencing shortness of breath, nocturnal wheezing, and a persistent cough that has become moderately severe. Despite utilizing his inhaled corticosteroid and short-acting beta-agonist inhaler as prescribed, he only experiences partial relief.

He has a notable history of asthma with frequent exacerbations, requiring various medication adjustments. His current asthma regimen includes an inhaled corticosteroid, a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler for acute symptoms, and a leukotriene receptor antagonist. The patient maintains strict adherence to his medication schedule yet reports ongoing nocturnal symptoms disrupting his sleep.

His past medical history is significant for osteoarthritis and prior knee patellar dislocations, which necessitated surgical intervention. He has experienced multiple issues related to his asthma, with diagnoses including unspecified asthma with and without acute exacerbation, chronic obstructive asthma, and extrinsic asthma.

The patient is a non-smoker, abstains from alcohol, and denies illicit drug use. Employed as a software engineer, he notes that stress at work may exacerbate his asthma symptoms. He lives alone and generally leads a sedentary lifestyle.

The patient reports no known drug allergies. His primary symptoms currently include shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing, primarily during the nighttime. These symptoms have persisted for approximately a week and fluctuate in severity. Temporary relief is noted with the use of his rescue inhaler.

He has made non-pharmacological attempts to manage his symptoms, such as using a humidifier and keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons, though the benefit has been minimal. There have been no significant side effects from his medications since the last visit, but he reports a slight increase in symptom severity.

**Objective:**
- **Vital Signs:** Blood Pressure: 128/84 mmHg | Heart Rate: 80 bpm | Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute | Temperature: 98.6Â°F | Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air.
- **General Appearance:** The patient appears well-groomed and is in no acute distress.
- **Cardiovascular:** Heart rate is regular, with normal S1 and S2 sounds. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops are present, nor is there any jugular venous distension or peripheral edema.
- **Respiratory:** Bilateral wheezes are noted on auscultation with a prolonged expiratory phase. There are no crackles or rhonchi, though mild intercostal retractions are observed.
- **Abdomen:** The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with normal bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
- **Musculoskeletal:** The patient exhibits a normal range of motion and strength in all extremities, with no swelling or tenderness in the joints.
- **Neurological:** The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II through XII are intact, and both motor and sensory examinations are within normal limits.
- **Skin:** The skin exhibits normal texture and color, with no rashes, lesions, or cyanosis.

**Laboratory Data:**
Recent laboratory results indicate normal eosinophil counts but an elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), which suggests systemic inflammation. Other hematological parameters, including Hemoglobin (HGB), Hematocrit (HCT), and White Blood Cell (WBC) counts, remain within normal ranges.

**Assessment:**
1. **Asthma:** Persistent asthma with nocturnal exacerbation, likely influenced by workplace stress and potential allergen exposure.
2. **Associated Conditions:** Suspected allergic triggers, osteoarthritis, and past knee-related surgical interventions.

**Plan:**
1. **Asthma Management:**
   - Continue the current inhaled corticosteroid and short-acting beta-agonist regimen.
   - Increase the dosage of the inhaled corticosteroid.
   - Add a long-acting beta-agonist inhaler for better symptom control.
   - Schedule pulmonary function tests to evaluate airway obstruction.

2. **Symptom Monitoring and Management:**
   - Maintain a detailed symptom diary to help identify and manage potential triggers.
   - Encourage non-pharmacological measures such as air filtration systems to enhance air quality.

3. **Referrals:**
   - Schedule a consultation with a pulmonologist for comprehensive asthma management.
   - Consider referring the patient for allergy testing to identify specific allergens contributing to his symptoms.

4. **Education:**
   - Educate the patient on proper inhaler techniques and stress the importance of strict adherence to the prescribed regimen.
   - Advise the patient to seek urgent care if symptoms escalate or if there is no significant improvement.

**Follow-Up:**
- Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate the need for further evaluation.
- Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to reassess asthma control and potentially adjust the treatment plan.

Provide assurance that the patient understands the plan and is agreeable to the outlined approach.
