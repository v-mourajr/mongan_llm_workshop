This is a 26-year-old Black male who speaks Spanish, presenting to our clinic on December 28, 2001, for a follow-up of his asthma, which he has been managing with medications and clinic supervision for approximately 2 years. He reports an increase in wheezing and shortness of breath over the past week, which he attributes to the colder weather and recent upper respiratory infection.

**Subjective:**
- Chief Complaints & History of Present Illness:

**Assessment:**
1. **Asthma, unspecified without mention of status asthmaticus**:
   - The patient is experiencing an exacerbation likely triggered by environmental and infectious factors.
   
2. **Chronic rhinitis** and **Allergic rhinitis**:
   - Contributing to upper respiratory irritation and possibly exacerbating asthma symptoms.
   
3. **Acute pharyngitis**:
   - Recent infection possibly aggravating his asthma.

**Plan:**
1. **Asthma Management**:
   - Continue Albuterol Sulfate 4mg as needed for acute symptoms. Educate the patient on the importance of adherence. Initiate Fluticasone inhaler 2 puffs twice daily for better control of symptoms.
   - Provide a peak flow meter to monitor daily lung function and identify early signs of exacerbation.

2. **Diagnostic Tests**:
   - Order a chest X-ray to rule out other causes of the cough.
   - Perform routine pulmonary function tests to assess the severity of asthma.
   
3. **Management of Rhinitis and Pharyngitis**:
   - Prescribe a nasal corticosteroid spray for chronic rhinitis.
   - Educate on avoidance of known allergens and proper nasal hygiene.

4. **Follow-Up**:
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to assess asthma control and adherence to the new inhaler regimen.
   - Instruct the patient to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, or if test results indicate further evaluation is needed.
   - Emphasize that any new or worsening symptoms, such as hemoptysis, severe chest pain, or significant dyspnea, should prompt immediate medical attention.

The patient has been educated on the new treatment plan, including medication use, peak flow monitoring, and allergen avoidance. Understanding confirmed.
