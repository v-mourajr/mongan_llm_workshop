This is a 30-year-old Asian male who has been a patient at our clinic for approximately 3 months. He is a Spanish speaker and presents today for follow-up on injuries related to a recent traumatic amputation of his fingers. He has been followed up diligently since the accident, which necessitated surgical intervention.

Subjective:
Chief Complaints & History of Present Illness:
The patient reports persistent pain and occasional numbness in his remaining fingers following a recent amputation procedure. He describes the pain as a "sharp, throbbing" sensation that intermittently follows physical activity or strain. The injury was sustained in an accident involving specified machinery approximately a month ago, leading to an amputation of his right index and middle fingers. He states that the last few weeks have involved significant physical and emotional adjustment to the loss of his fingers.

Past Medical & Surgical History:
The recent traumatic amputation of the right index and middle fingers required a disarticulation surgery. There is also a history of minor injuries associated with this machinery accident but no previous surgeries of note.

Medications & Supplements:
The patient is currently prescribed an analgesic (Acetaminophen) for pain management, which has provided moderate relief. He is also on antibiotics (Amoxicillin) to prevent infection post-surgery. He reports taking a daily multivitamin supplement but denies any use of herbal supplements.

Social History:
The patient resides with his family and is employed as a machinist, which led to the recent injury. He denies tobacco or alcohol use and emphasizes a diet high in fruits and vegetables. Physical activity has been limited due to his recent surgery and ongoing recovery.

Allergies:
The patient reports no known drug allergies.

Symptom Details:
Pain onset is usually post-activity and peaks at night, occasionally disturbing his sleep. The numbness, though not constant, tends to occur in colder temperatures or when placing strain on his hand.

Additional Narrative:
Non-pharmacological interventions include the use of a custom-made hand brace and physical therapy aimed at improving function and strength in his remaining fingers. The patient has attended therapy sessions twice a week and reports some improvement in dexterity and strength. No side effects from his medications have been reported. He states fluctuations in symptom intensity but has adhered to all prescribed treatments and modifications.
